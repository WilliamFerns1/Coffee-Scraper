This selection is illustrative of the effects longer fermentation times can have on flavor profile. In the cup we find a very sweet and more fruit forward profile of grape and berries, a subtle citrus acidity, and a delicate florality.

This selection is a lovely example of the compounded effects of slightly longer fermentation times and microclimate temperature variation. We generally separate coffee into two major categories based on processing: washed and natural. Within these two different methodologies, however, there are an incalculable number of variables in play. For example, the specific ecology in and around a specific farm can vary widely, and the ambient temperature at the time of processing directly affects the speed of fermentation. The list of such variables is long, but the important thing to try and understand is how these variables influence final cup profiles. This coffee is an interesting example of bringing out more fruit-forward qualities through slightly longer fermentation, even though this is technically a washed coffee.

This is a field blend of the three most commonly grown varieties in Colombia: Castillo, Variety Colombia, and Caturra. Both Castillo and V. Colombia are Catimor hybrids, which give them high disease resistance. Caturra, on the other hand, is a natural mutation of Bourbon, and is very susceptible to disease.","November, 2020",64e5b1002a0096c6f9935338,Sey Coffee,https://www.seycoffee.com/,https://www.seycoffee.com/collections/coffee,USD,2023-10-17T17:34:09.810Z,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kenya in the famed region of Nyeri. In the cup we find intense aromatics, classic Kenyan acidities of red currant and raspberry, and a red wine-like complexity. Our journey of buying coffees from Kenya continues. Kenya is a difficult place to work in not only because of its distance from New York, but also the complicated structure of the Kenyan coffee industry itself. The coffees available to purchase directly from single estates are generally lower quality than those we encounter from the larger cooperatives, but working with the co-ops creates its own issues of transparency, traceability, and the impossibility of making meaningful partnerships and investments towards better coffee, soil health, and farming practices. This particular co-op has 489 members, each of whom has an extremely small farm averaging about half a hectare (1.2 acres). Despite all of its challenges, Kenya continues to produce some of the most dynamic and complex coffees in the world, and we'll continue trying to evolve how we work in this special country as the years continue.","January, 2021",64e5b1002a0096c6f9935338,Sey Coffee,https://www.seycoffee.com/,https://www.seycoffee.com/collections/coffee,USD,2023-10-17T17:34:09.810Z,,,,,,,,,,,,

We had expressed our interest in purchasing coffees from less explored regions of Ethiopia, and—after tasting some very good offer samples from Hamasho—decided this was exactly what we were looking for. Around 1,500 farmers deliver their coffee to this washing station way up in the Bombe Mountains. Due to the extreme elevations these coffees are grown in, the seeds are very small and dense. Ethiopia is widely acknowledged as where coffee originated, and its production continues to represent about 10% of the country’s gross domestic product. DNA testing has confirmed over 60 distinct varieties growing in Ethiopia, making it home to the most coffee biodiversity of any region in the world. Given the tradition of coffee production in Ethiopia and the political interworkings of the Ethiopian coffee trade, it is virtually impossible to get single variety coffee lots from Ethiopia.

ABOUT PEDRO MORENO
We have been working with the Moreno family on the mountain of Santa Bárbara for quite a while now, and we have really come to love these coffees. As we continue to work within this special region, our exploration and understanding of the specific terroir and flavor profiles of these coffees continues to become more sophisticated. This particular selection from El Mango, a newer micro lot separation, is a beautiful example of one of our favorite profiles that we try to seek out year after year. We find it to be entirely unique to Santa Bárbara, and we hope that these coffees and profiles will continue to be around for years to come.

ABOUT PACAS
Pacas is a natural mutation of Bourbon from the Bourbon/Typica group mainly found in El Salvador and Honduras. Similar to other Bourbon mutants, Pacas has a single-gene mutation that causes the plant to grow smaller (dwarfism). Unlike the hybrid varieties, Pacas is very susceptible to disease, making it riskier to grow.","May, 2021",64e5b1002a0096c6f9935338,Sey Coffee,https://www.seycoffee.com/,https://www.seycoffee.com/collections/coffee,USD,2023-10-17T17:34:09.810Z,,,,,,,,,,,,

ABOUT ODOLA TEBEAROWACHO This a new washing station for us, however, we have worked extensively in the region of Uraga for many years now. This is a newer washing station in the area, having been built in 2016. As with most washing stations in Ethiopia, all of the coffee that makes up this lot comes from smallholding producers who harvest from personal gardens surrounding their homes, as well as wild coffee being grown close by. The average size of these small gardens is around .5 to 2 hectares (1.2 to 5 acres). ABOUT ETHIOPIAN LANDRACE Ethiopia is widely acknowledged as where coffee originated, and its production continues to represent about 10% of the country’s gross domestic product. Estimates guess that there are potentially up to thousands of varieties growing in Ethiopia, making it home to the most coffee biodiversity of any region in the world. Given the tradition of coffee production in Ethiopia and the political interworkings of the Ethiopian coffee trade, it is extremely difficult to get single variety coffee lots from Ethiopia. This is changing, albeit very slowly. Most Ethiopian coffees are blends of the many Ethiopian varieties, and referred to simply as 'Ethiopian Landrace'.","January, 2021",64e5b1002a0096c6f9935338,Sey Coffee,https://www.seycoffee.com/,https://www.seycoffee.com/collections/coffee,USD,2023-10-17T17:34:09.810Z,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yerlin Arturo Jojoa Rosero moved to Finca Bella María in 2013 at the age of 15, and has been working this farm with his family ever since.

The farms in this region are some of the most remote in Colombia, and still use the most traditional farming and processing practices. Most everything is still done by hand. It is easy to romanticize this way of life, but it is necessary to remember how difficult it can be for these farmers to live and produce coffee in such places. Castillo is a hybrid variety. It is a cross between Caturra and a Timor Robusta. In 1962 research began to create coffee leaf rust resistant varieties. Leaf rust is responsible for decimating many coffee growing regions throughout history. Castillo was released in 1982, and has been widely adopted in Colombia to combat leaf rust; breathing new life into coffee production within the country.

ABOUT MAXIMILIANO GARCIA ABAD
Maximiliano is an extremely dedicated first-generation producer. When he and his wife moved to San Ignacio, Maximiliano worked as a day laborer on other coffee farms until they saved enough to buy their own land. Since then, they have become model producers for the region by participating in every training available to them, and continuing to learn and invest in their farm each year. Peru is a new exploration for us, and one that we are extremely excited about because we feel that the potential there is very, very high. Look forward to more and more lots coming from Peru in the years to come.

ABOUT PARAINEMA
Parainema is an introgressed Sarchimor variety. It was bred by the Honduran Institute of Coffee, and has been planted throughout Honduras. At high altitudes, it has good cup potential, moderate disease resistance, and better than average yields.","July, 2021",64e5b1002a0096c6f9935338,Sey Coffee,https://www.seycoffee.com/,https://www.seycoffee.com/collections/coffee,USD,2023-10-17T17:34:09.810Z,,,,,,,,,,,,

ABOUT DANCHE
Neguesse Debela started operating his first site in Worka Chelbessa in 2017, but quickly expanded in 2019 by buying another washing station a few kilometers away in a small sub-area of Worka Chelbessa called Danche. The two sites execute immaculate washed and natural processed coffees, and are working to create unique experimental lots in an effort to continue improving the quality of their production.

ABOUT ETHIOPIAN LANDRACE
Ethiopia is widely acknowledged as where coffee originated, and its production continues to represent about 10% of the country’s gross domestic product. DNA testing has confirmed over 60 distinct varieties growing in Ethiopia, making it home to the most coffee biodiversity of any region in the world. Given the tradition of coffee production in Ethiopia and the political interworkings of the Ethiopian coffee trade, it is virtually impossible to get single variety coffee lots from Ethiopia. This is changing, albeit very slowly. Most Ethiopian coffees are blends of the many Ethiopian varieties, and referred to simply as 'Ethiopian Landrace'.","January, 2022",64e5b1002a0096c6f9935338,Sey Coffee,https://www.seycoffee.com/,https://www.seycoffee.com/collections/coffee,USD,2023-10-17T17:34:09.810Z,,,,,,,,,,,,

ABOUT DUROMINA
Duromina opened for its first harvest season in the fall of 2010. It is located in the southern end of Agaro Gera. Coffees from this particular area are exquisitely clean, and some of the most sought after coffees world wide. Duromina is also part of the famous Kata Muduga Cooperative, and a product of the TechnoServe project—which focuses on improving the lives of African coffee farmers by helping them get better prices for their coffee. It is, without question, one of the most successful development projects within specialty coffee.

ABOUT ETHIOPIAN LANDRACE
Ethiopia is widely acknowledged as where coffee originated, and its production continues to represent about 10% of the country’s gross domestic product. DNA testing has confirmed over 60 distinct varieties growing in Ethiopia, making it home to the most coffee biodiversity of any region in the world. Given the tradition of coffee production in Ethiopia and the political interworkings of the Ethiopian coffee trade, it is virtually impossible to get single variety coffee lots from Ethiopia. This is changing, albeit very slowly. Most Ethiopian coffees are blends of the many Ethiopian varieties, and referred to simply as 'Ethiopian Landrace'.","November, 2022",64e5b1002a0096c6f9935338,Sey Coffee,https://www.seycoffee.com/,https://www.seycoffee.com/collections/coffee,USD,2023-10-17T17:34:09.810Z,,,,,,,,,,,,

Once married, they bought a farm high up in Urrao, and decided to focus on quality by planting a variety we love: Chiroso. In the cup we find a structured profile, excellent density, and notes of gooseberry and lemongrass. Marta and Jose bought their farm nearly 24 years ago, and were keen to continue farming as a way of life. Marta grew up farming coffee in Betania, and so, with her lead, she and Jose focused on producing their own high-quality coffee. Marta now works primarily with the harvest, overseeing processing and drying. Their coffee is excellent, and we look forward to deepening our exploration of this region and its many inspiring producers. Chiroso is a new variety being grown primarily in the region of Antioquia, Colombia. We only started hearing about its cultivation a couple of years ago, but because of its cup quality potential it is beginning to spread. The variety has been genetically identified as an Ethiopian Landrace, but we unfortunately cannot get any more specific than that at this time. We have been working very hard building a buying program in the region of Urrao specifically around the variety of Chiroso. We still don't know where or how this variety came to be cultivated in this particular region, but its cup quality is extraordinary.

ABOUT DANCHE
Neguesse Debela started operating his first site in Worka Chelbessa in 2017, but quickly expanded in 2019 by buying another washing station a few kilometers away in a small sub-area of Worka Chelbessa called Danche. The two sites execute immaculate washed and natural processed coffees, and are now working to create unique experimental lots in an effort to continue improving the quality of their production.

ABOUT ETHIOPIAN LANDRACE
Ethiopia is widely acknowledged as where coffee originated, and its production continues to represent about 10% of the country’s gross domestic product. DNA testing has confirmed over 60 distinct varieties growing in Ethiopia, making it home to the most coffee biodiversity of any region in the world. Given the tradition of coffee production in Ethiopia and the political interworkings of the Ethiopian coffee trade, it is virtually impossible to get single variety coffee lots from Ethiopia. This is changing, albeit very slowly. Most Ethiopian coffees are blends of the many Ethiopian varieties, and referred to simply as 'Ethiopian Landrace'.","December, 2022",64e5b1002a0096c6f9935338,Sey Coffee,https://www.seycoffee.com/,https://www.seycoffee.com/collections/coffee,USD,2023-10-17T17:34:09.810Z,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gildardo's coffee regularly dominates regional competitions, and this year is no different––taking first place in the Central Region of the Copa de Oro. This is our third year working with this coffee, and it continues to impress. Pink Bourbon is a variety known for the complexity of its acidity and fruit characteristics. The physical look of the seeds and plant, along with its distinct flavor profile, point towards it being an Ethiopian Landrace variety. However, to our knowledge Pink Bourbon has yet to be genetically tested, so we cannot say with certainty what exactly it is.

Two key families have been at the heart of this regional fame: the Paz family, who owns San Vicente, the company responsible for milling and exporting the coffees from the region, and the Moreno family, a farming family who has championed specialty coffee and the benefits it brings and have encouraged many other producers in the region to begin producing specialty coffee over commodity coffee.

The Moreno family patriarch, Daniel Moreno, started coffee farming in 1963 with the purchase of El Campo, a plantation that is still in production and now managed by his seven sons: Miguel, Mario, Jesus, Gerardo, Olvin, Mabel and Danny. In addition to El Campo, the brothers inherited their own farms from their father, who divided El Filo into lots for each son. Together the Morenos built a wet mill, raised beds, and solar dryers to process and prepare specialty coffee. The family helps and motivates other farmers in the region to produce and prepare better quality by sharing their knowledge and even facilities. There is palpable ambition in the area. Ambition to produce excellent coffee, to get paid well for their efforts, and to continue being considered the best coffee producing region in Honduras.

Passenger purchased two distinct lots produced by Olvin Moreno in 2019, keeping them fresh in deep freeze storage since their arrival in the States that summer. This particular lot is a pacas variety selection from Olvin’s Pinares Plot: a small farm located just below a protected forest reserve on Santa Barbara mountain.",,64e5b0e92a0096c6f9935336,Passenger Coffee,https://www.passengercoffee.com/,https://www.passengercoffee.com/collections/coffee,USD,2023-10-17T15:19:36.697Z,,,,,,,,,,,,

During early conversations with producers at Divino Niño, we frequently heard of a coffee variety that is locally referred to as “variedad Cantillo”. While the trees of this variety are not particularly distinctive, the ripe cherries are rather unique in appearance, being bright yellowish orange in color with beautiful mottled “tiger-stripes”. While the precise genetic lineage of this mystery “Cantillo family” coffee variety is thus far unknown, our best guess is that it is a natural mutation of variedad Colombia, a very commonly cultivated Catimor hybrid with excellent disease resistance that is capable of producing excellent cup quality.

One thing that really sets Passenger apart as a roasting company is our ongoing practice of freezing green (unroasted) coffee. As one of very few specialty roasting companies that freeze coffee on an ambitious scale, Passenger devotes a significant amount of time and money to freezer operations, and given that many of our peers opt not to adopt this strategy, we are often asked why we prioritize it to such an extent. While there are many reasons that we freeze our coffees, cup quality (and consistency) is certainly one of the most significant.

To some extent, one cannot truly appreciate the quality benefits of freezing coffee without an appreciation for the potential quality loss without freezing coffee. The present coffee pairing includes frozen and unfrozen versions of the same 2021 Colombian competition lot from producer Luz Raigosa (i.e. a portion that was frozen before roasting and a portion that was not), providing a unique opportunity for tasters to gain a better appreciation for the quality benefits, and possibilities, of green coffee preservation in the freezer.

The set includes:

A 10 oz. bag of Colombian producer Luz Raigosa’s competition winning microlot, that has been kept preserved in frozen storage, prior to roasting, since its arrival to the States (Spring, 2022).

A 5 oz. bag of the same competition lot from Luz Raigosa, that was not preserved in the freezer prior to roasting.

The Villalobos was originally separated from the Red Catuai on the farm and cultivated in a nursery to spur its production. It has a low yield of cherries, hence, there is a very limited commercial production adding to its scarcity. The Villalobos is processed via the black honey method. This involves de-pulping the cherry skin and leaving as much mucilage on the seed as possible to intensify the sweetness of the coffee. Diego is a university graduate in mechanical engineering. Now at the helm of the farm, Diego has created his own pre-drying system for processing coffee in all methods. This is similar to a large cooling tray from a coffee roaster. The premise is having the hot air blowing from the bottom of the tray to dry the cherries in their initial phase. The constant rotation of the tray also helps with the drying uniformity. This process helps save up to two days of drying which would traditionally be done on a concrete patio. After our trip to Costa Rica this year, Proud Mary will reinvest into the lab, the aim being to fortify some strong facilities for research and development on the farm.

In addition to producing its own coffees, Guji Highland processes and exports coffee from nearby smallholder farmers, as is typical of centralized washing stations in Ethiopia. This Hiddi lot comes from local smallholder farmers who have gained market access via this method. Guji Highland are experts in natural coffee processing, and the evidence is in the beautifully balanced yet striking cup profiles they produce. After ripe red cherries are delivered by the farmers, Guji Highland processing specialists place the coffee on raised beds three feet above the ground. As the cherries dry, they are hand-turned and sorted to ensure even drying and prevent mildew from growing. During the night, the cherries are covered to protect them from the elements and cold temperatures. As an organic operation, Guji and its partner farmers rely on the incredibly rich soils of the Guji region and shade of indigenous shade trees to cultivate their thriving coffee plants.

About the Farm
Manuel was born in the village of Nueva Esperanza, near Santa Barbara, where he initially learned and worked in coffee production. Manuel moved to the US in order to pursue other work and in recent years decided to work and invest in coffee production once more. He has since planted Los Primos, motivated and influenced by friends working with specialty coffee. 2014 marked Los Primos’ first harvest. Manuel has strictly planted the Pacas varietal based on its cup quality.

Among the hanafuda (Japanese playing cards), the picture of ""sakura ni maku"" (cherry blossoms with a curtain) in March is famous. The custom of enjoying cherry blossoms has been popular since the Heian period, and it is said that by hanging a curtain between the trees, they indicated that it was a place for flower viewing. Instead of a curtain, beautiful kimonos were hung on the ropes, and people enjoyed not only the cherry blossoms but also the kimonos. In this blend, we have slightly changed the atmosphere and imagined the purplish-pink spring between day and night, at the dusk. The taste is a refreshing flavour that gently and softly spreads, like a strawberry, with a rounded sweetness and aroma of plum. You can feel the relaxed moment of the spring evening with this blend. 【Cupping Comment】① A soft and fluffy strawberry flavor with the sourness of plum. ② The gentle sweetness of a warm black tea. ③ The lingering sweetness of round candies and honey continues for a long time.",,64e5b07a2a0096c6f9935332,Lilo Coffee,https://coffee.liloinveve.com/,https://coffee.liloinveve.com/collections/coffee/blend?locale=en_us,JPY,2023-10-17T11:49:54.755Z,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike most cultivated coffee, it flourishes untamed in the valleys that descend from the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain. The variety, Yellow Typica, is exceptionally rare due to its susceptibility to pests and diseases. However, within these valleys, it has been carefully preserved and nurtured by the Kankuwamo tribe, the indigenous inhabitants of the region. The journey to reach the coffee was an arduous one, requiring hours of travel by car, mule, and finally, foot as the dense jungle impeded our progress. Nevertheless, the effort proved worthwhile as we discovered a truly enchanting place.

Today, the Silva family continues to uphold this rich heritage while embracing novel, sustainable agricultural methodologies to safeguard the farm's vitality for generations to come. Rafael has instituted a vermicompost program that generates organic compost directly on the farm, thereby significantly reducing the reliance on chemical fertilizers.

El Morito sits at an elevation ranging from 1,400 to 2,350 meters above sea level, with certain pockets reaching a staggering 2,650 meters. The lower altitudes are suited to producing sweet and balanced coffees whereas the higher altitudes are suited to more bright, complex, and delicate coffees. El Morito stretches across a sprawling 672 hectares. Within this vast expanse, you'll find 523.4-hectare forest, mostly untouched and home to a mesmerizing variety of trees like pine, cypress, and oak. coffee trees flourish beneath the natural canopy, creating an ideal symbiosis. But there's more to El Morito than just coffee. They're deeply invested in their community, providing funding for local schools and medical services to their workers amongst other things. And if you needed more proof of their coffee excellence, El Morito has consistently shone in the Cup of Excellence competition, with an impressive record of eight placements including 1st place in 2022!",,64e5b0922a0096c6f9935333,Proud Mary Coffee,https://proudmarycoffee.com/,https://proudmarycoffee.com/collections/all-coffee,USD,2023-10-17T14:45:53.281Z,,,,,,,,,,,,

A coffee with sweet and vibrant berry flavors that fill your mouth, followed by the refreshing scent and acidity reminiscent of peaches. Even the air that escapes to your nose will be a delightful experience. During the damp period of the rainy season, please enjoy a moment of brightness with our vibrant coffee time.",,64e5b07a2a0096c6f9935332,Lilo Coffee,https://coffee.liloinveve.com/,https://coffee.liloinveve.com/collections/coffee/blend?locale=en_us,JPY,2023-10-17T11:49:54.755Z,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the top of an old staircase, there stood an ancient coffee shop. It was said that a door to travel through time would appear therein. On a Halloween of a particular year, the town was enveloped in thick fog, and in the coffee shop appeared a beautiful witch draped in a black cloak. She began to serve a special brew of coffee, and those who drank it vanished in an instant. One sip, and they were transported to the past. To right their regrets, to chase dreams anew, they found themselves whisked away to bygone eras. And when they returned, they recognized the importance of living in the present, making each day meaningful. The witch proclaimed, ""Time is to be savored one moment at a time.

The drivers, desperate, insisted that the townsfolk accept the deliveries. That night, something magical occurred. The boxes opened on their own, releasing a sweet and delightful aroma that spread throughout the homes. Suddenly, everyday items began to spring to life as if enchanted.

Kenyan coffee is known for its acidity brightness, yet somehow Karatina AA offers one of the most balanced cup of coffee we have yet to offer.

Tulip“Tulipan” (Tulip) is designed for coffees with lower acidity like typical Bourbons from El Salvador, Brazil or Indian coffees. The cone shaped cup enhances more earthy aromas and gives you an impression that the coffee is very sweet as the liquid enters the mouth in a narrow stream and hits the middle of the tongue.Split“Splitt” (Split) is designed for coffees with intense fruity and floral aromas and bright acidity. Typically we use these cups for our Kenyan and Ethiopian coffees. The unique design enhances the aromatics when you smell the coffee in the cup and the wide shape makes the liquid enter your mouth with a wider spread so that you perceive acidity more clearly.Open“Åpen” (Open) is more of an all-round cup. The classic U-shape is a forgiving shape when it comes to taste balance yet it has the ability to intensify aromas when you smell the coffees. We typically use these cups for coffees that have fruity characters and medium intense acidity.

The farm itself is in constant improvements, working with locals, and encouraging innovation within the nature of the region. There are several varieties planted there, with new lots every year, but also holding onto old varieties also. This variety comes from very old Bourbon trees - which have been planted over 50 years ago at FES. The trees and root systems are this old, but they have been pruned and trimmed and are producing well. While most of the Old Bourbon has been replaced with more modern varieties, this lot is still thriving. Rodolfo has decided to keep the last lot of these trees, and has named it Borbonera. The cherries were harvested ripe, and sorted well before being macerated for 120 hours in low oxygen conditions (Anaerobic like). They were then dried on raised beds in cherry.

Project Origin learnt a vast amount from our experiences refining the CM process here, and the coffee from this station deservedly went on to win at the 2018 World Barista Championships. Project Origin and Primrose also partnered up to fund the construction of a bridge over the nearby river, to allow passage between the nearby town and school and the washing station, saving the local community from traversing 1-2 hours to the next nearest river crossing. Here ripe cherries are picked and then sorted for any defects before processing begins. The cherries are placed in sealed tanks and filled with CO2, pushing oxygen out. They are fermented at cool temperatures for an extended time - giving this darker fruit note to the cup profile. They're then removed, pulped, and washed, before being dried for 20-30 days until around 11% moisture.

Shipping included. Hear more about it from our founder, Ralf. About Low Caf Beans Low-caffeine coffee plants are incredibly rare, because caffeine acts as a protection against coffee plant diseases. This makes Laurina and Aramosa varietals extremely hard to grow. Both naturally contain only 0.3-0.7% caffeine (regular Arabica coffee has up to 1.8%). They taste delicious - just like our other fully caffeinated beans. Our low-caffeine varietals are always roasted as omni roast so you can enjoy these coffees both on filter or espresso methods.

The four uniquely styled blades not only allow for faster and even distribution of coffee, but with the advanced, anti-static coating, significantly reduce the amount of coffee that sticks to the tool after each use. However you desire your coffee dose, you can easily adjust the height of the NCD with millimeter accuracy to maximise flavour from each puck. Former World Barista Champion Sasa Sestic designed this tool to get the best possible flavours out of your espresso. Sliding gently over your grounded beans the four revolutionary angles slopes create an even surface in the basket of your portafilter. This reduces the risk of uneven extractions significantly which will result in a richer coffee experience. 58.5mm diameter fits both IMD and VST basket Made of brass (to reduce static) and lightweight anodized aluminium Advanced static-reducing coating Adjustable to accommodate the desired dose Textured non-slip design for grip",,64e5aeb32a0096c6f993532b,The Barn,https://thebarn.de/,https://thebarn.de/collections/beans,EUR,2023-10-17T11:18:04.395Z,,,,,,,,,,,,

This year, we are continuing our collaboration with Roble Negro and the first release is three coffees of the catuai variety from the farmer Jorge Vasquez. The difference in the coffees is all down to processing: one is Washed, one is Honey processed, one is Natural. In more simple terms, it is all down to the amount of natural fruit sugars that have been allowed to stay and ferment on the coffee bean whilst drying. This is the perfect opportunity to experience the isolated affect of processing on the coffee flavour experience. The Washed processed coffee has the most pure flavour of the terroir, or soils and climate, of the three coffees. Super sweet and balanced, we experience apple, orange blossom and sugar cane in the cup. The name Roble Negro means “black oak” and Cedral Alto means “high cedar grove”. These names indicate the importance of trees, forestation, and environmental preservation to Jorge and his coffee production. Cedral Alto is 22.5 hectares, with 12 hectares of primary forest, 6.5 hectares of reforestation and pasture land, and 3 hectares of coffee cultivation.

The difference in the coffees is all down to processing: one is Washed, one is Honey processed, one is Natural. In more simple terms, it is all down to the amount of natural fruit sugars that have been allowed to stay and ferment on the coffee bean whilst drying. This is the perfect opportunity to experience the isolated affect of processing on the coffee flavour experience. The Natural processed coffee has a lovely summer fruits-driven flavour from the fermentation. Think of sweet and juicy cherries and strawberries. The name Roble Negro means “black oak” and Cedral Alto means “high cedar grove”. These names indicate the importance of trees, forestation, and environmental preservation to Jorge and his coffee production. Cedral Alto is 22.5 hectares, with 12 hectares of primary forest, 6.5 hectares of reforestation and pasture land, and 3 hectares of coffee cultivation. The farm is filled with natural springs and freshwater sources, which the forested areas protect and keep clean, and is situated at the transition between the Pacific side of the country and the Central Valley region, spanning 1750–2000 meters above sea level.",,64e5ad552a0096c6f993531f,Prolog Coffee,https://www.prologcoffee.com/,https://www.prologcoffee.com/collections/buy-our-coffee,USD,2023-10-17T13:01:20.484Z,,,,,,,,,,,,

Think of some really high-quality sweet, juicy jammy flavours. This year is no different, and we’ve made sure to buy even more of this coffee this time around so we can further share those experiences. At the Kigari wet mill, the cherries are pulped and fully washed, as is typical in Kenya as a whole. The beans are then dried, sorted and graded to ensure only the highest quality, ripest beans are contained within this lot. The coffee factory is very well managed and practices different kinds of businesses besides from the coffee production. For example, they rent out part of their property to national sports teams due to the high elevation. Moreover, they are extremely involved in agriculture, like coffee, and own pigs and cows that they tend to as well. This also enables them to teach their students right on the compound.

This naturally processed lot grown on the El Panal plot is picked, sorted and patio dried for 18-25 days. Finca La Bolsa was bought by Jorge Vides, a distinguished medical professional, in 1958. Prior to this the land wasn’t used for coffee production. Jorge won a number of awards for coffee production and for services to the region of Huehuetenango, and had the main hospital in the coffee growing community named after him. La Bolsa competed in the 2002 Cup Of Excellence competition and placed second, scoring 94.98. La Bolsa sits between two mountains, which provide a very stable, humid microclimate. This combined with the limestone rich soils give the coffee a very unique profile, with a rich syrupy body and plenty of malic and citric acidity.

This area, in the high altitude humid forests where the Great Rift Valley passes into South Sudan, is thought to be the birthplace of Arabica coffee, and is still home to great genetic diversity. Here at Gesha Village however, one varietal sits in the spotlight; Geisha. Adam Overton and Rachel Samuel first travelled to Ethiopia in 2007 to make a documentary about its unique method of coffee production, and fell in love with the country. They decided during that short trip that they would eventually move to the country to start producing coffee themselves. They found a 471 hectare plot of land in Bench Maji, further west than we normally find specialty coffee in Ethiopia, in a remote area of untouched high altitude forest. The wild forest remained as coffee was planted, maintaining as much as possible of the biodiversity so crucial to the Ethiopian mode of production, while also providing ample shade for the fragile Geisha trees.",,64e5aa302a0096c6f993531a,La Cabra,https://www.lacabra.dk,https://www.lacabra.dk/collections/coffee,DKK,2023-10-17T12:18:51.628Z,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has everything we look for in a naturally processed Ethiopian coffee, the “red” profile bringing big, juicy and tropical notes whilst retaining delicate and beautiful florals.",,64e5acd12a0096c6f993531c,Round Hill Roastery,https://roundhillroastery.com/,https://roundhillroastery.com/shop/,GBP,2023-10-15T21:06:50.107Z,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is pretty new for both Nordic Approach and Tropiq as, until 3 years ago, all coffee was traded through the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange, ECX.

Tegu is a Kikuyu name that roughly translates to “low place”. The station processes cherries from about 1200 smallholders who on average have about 0.4 hectares of coffee trees. The washing station has built up a strong reputation for producing excellent coffee and has been able to secure prices above the market standard and give over 85% of that sale price back to farmers. At Tegu they process an astounding 330 tons of cherries per year, primarily SL 28 and SL 34 although increasingly we are seeing more Batian and Ruiri 11, two varieties developed in Kenya for their high yield and good disease resistance and resilience.

AB or AA refer to the screen size of the beans, the screen size for an AB is between 16 and 17, not quite but almost the smallest size in which each of these sizes is 1/64th of an inch. This method of sorting was traditionally done by sifting the green beans through progressively smaller holed metal sheets so as to categorise them based on size. The screen size doesn’t directly correlate to quality as variety, altitude and soil composition all have a big impact on the growth and taste of the end product.

This small plot, located at 1700 masl in the Central Valley of Costa Rica, grows only SL28 and Geisha, and is cared for meticulously by Jose and Daisy themselves. Due to the close connection the family feel to the plot, and its literal proximity, the plot was named in Daisy’s honour. This small area of the farm has only been in production for 2 years, so this is only Jose and Daisy’s third ever harvest of Geisha, with full SL28 harvests expected over the next two years. Attention to fermentation: Due to the meticulous care that these plants have received, and Jose’s close attention to fermentation, this is one of the finest examples of Geisha we have ever tasted from Costa Rica. The red honey process is carried out with incredible precision in the family’s own micro mill. The cherries are depulped carefully with a Penagos Ecopulper, which uses very minimal water, and allows very precise control of the amount of fruity flesh left on the seed. This has been slowly dialled in by Jose over previous harvests, leaving what he would describe as a red honey process, leaving enough fruit on the seed to impart a heavy sweetness and body during drying, but allowing the clean Geisha characteristics to shine through. In the cup this means jasmine aromas, typical of the Geisha variety, and some classic Costa Rican characteristics, flavours of fresh honeydew melon and a slightly grapefruit finish.",,64e5aa302a0096c6f993531a,La Cabra,https://www.lacabra.dk,https://www.lacabra.dk/collections/coffee,DKK,2023-10-17T12:18:51.628Z,,,,,,,,,,,,

Benedito previously worked for a well-known producer in the area, José Myaki, who was a big part of inspiring Benedito to start his own coffee venture. Due to the flat and forgiving landscape, Abrão and Benedito can utilise a very high level of mechanisation in their day to day work, allowing them to run the farm alone for most of the year. They take on a few temporary workers for around two months over harvest time, helping to maintain quality in picking and processing. Inspired by the work of his original teacher, Benedito aims to produce ever higher quality on his farm as opposed to expanding like many in the region.

This lot comes from one of METAD’s largest washing stations in the Gedeb region, at Halo Beriti.

Therefore, we know that this lot comes from farmers around the village of Chelbesa, and that it is grown between 2100 and 2300 masl. Ethiopia’s mode of growing, with a high level of biodiversity, healthy fertile soils, and excellent climatic conditions lead to some of the highest quality raw material we find anywhere in the coffee belt.

Nyeri city is a major center for coffee in the Mount Kenya region, home to several dry mills and large warehouses, where coffee is stored before being taken to port in Mombasa.

Kenya reveals itself from behind forests of lush green, contrasting with the iconic dusty red volcanic soil. These soils, alongside mostly dry and warm conditions during harvest, are some of the keys behind Kenya’s incredible coffee quality potential.

They found a 471 hectare plot of land in Bench Maji, further west than we normally find specialty coffee in Ethiopia, in a remote area of untouched high altitude forest.

During the growing year, the microclimate surrounding their farm provides ample rainfall, low night time temperature, and rich soil. After picking, the cherry is fermented for 24 hours before being washed. The washed beans are then dried on beds in the sun for 14 days.

Earlier this year, our head of roasting, Ryan, was privileged enough to travel to Addis Ababa and meet Mustefa, spending the morning together as his coffee was milled.

It is classic Jimma coffee, bursting with big stone fruit flavours and cleansing acidity. We are over the moon to have this coffee back once again.

In 2017, a legislative change in the Ethiopian coffee industry made it easier for producers to gain export licenses, allowing them to sell more directly to customers like Seven Seeds. A somewhat radical change to the ECX ( Ethiopia coffee exchange ) allowed for more vertical integration, removing market entry barriers for producers. Mustefa Abalulessa was one of the first producers to gain such a license, and after an initial meeting at origin in 2018, Seeds could purchase directly from Mustefa in 2021. Changes like these have made establishing and maintaining direct relationships with smaller coffee exporters easier, removing bureaucracy and improving pricing transparency.

One of our most popular coffees in 2022, we’re thrilled to re-introduce this season’s Koke Honey. This coffee comes from the Koke and Birbes Kela washing stations in the famed Yirgacheffe woreda in Ethiopia.

The aromatic profile of Koke Honey is unmistakably akin to ripe blueberries. Flavors of muddled mango and peach dominate the cup, with a honey-like sweetness and heavier body than typical washed-process coffees from the same region. A particularly well-structured coffee, its fruit-forward acidity and subtle floral notes remain intact as it cools.

Koke Honey, as its name implies, is a honey-processed coffee. The coffee cherries were fermented in-cherry for two days prior to being pulped. The pulped coffee was then dried on raised beds until optimal humidity was reached. The extra time that the cherry and inner mucilage is in contact with the beans adds fruity flavors and depth to the coffee.

Yirgacheffe holds a special place in the hearts of coffee enthusiasts. Considered by many to be the birthplace of coffee, Yirgacheffe translates as “Land of Many Springs,” which is in keeping with its ideal topography, elevation and water sources needed to produce some of the most sought-after coffees in the world.",,64e5b1852a0096c6f993533d,Mammoth Coffee Company,https://mammothcoffee.co/,https://mammothcoffee.co/collections/coffee,,,,250g,,,,,,,,,,

The coffee dries complete with pulp and peel, for 15 days, preserving all of the fruit’s intense flavors. You’ll be amazed at the flavors that shine through!

Whether you are backpacking through the rockies or camping in a state park the perfect cup is moments away. Both components, the pitcher and lid are made of food safe silicon. The pitcher features excess padding towards the bottom to prevent burning when in use. One of the most impressive innovative features is the stainless steel flow control gate and tapered spout. The gate has three options for different flow rates via the 3mm, 4mm or 5mm holes. This blocks flow and provides a very consistent flow rate which then shoots down the tapered spout on its way to the dripper. We recommend preheating the pitcher, especially if you’re at elevation to keep your brewing water nice and hot. The functional capacity of the pitcher is ~360ml which is enough to yield a 10 fl oz brew.",,64e5b2a92a0096c6f9935349,Intelligentsia Coffee,https://www.intelligentsia.com/,https://www.intelligentsia.com/collections/coffee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This particular iteration of our Nectar is a blend of a honey processed Honduras lot that makes up 60% and then the other 40% is our Natural Ethiopia Ardi. The Honduras adds a silky, sweet body while the Ardi adds rich fruitiness, texture, and a berry-like acidity underneath the body. 

***You may be wondering where we got the name Nectar. I wish we could say we came up with it, but really we owe that all to a special account of ours in Southern California, JOi Cafe. We have been working hands on with them for awhile now and the Nectar started as a collaboration for their house espresso unique to them.

We find this coffee to be an incredible representation of the progress and process that decaffeination methods have made in recent years. This particular lot was naturally processed and dried on raised beds before it was selected by Royal to undergo Swiss Water processing in Canada. This particular processing method ensures that most of the inherent flavor qualities of the coffee are well maintained and we can attest to that.

Also, we are honored to have this coffee be awarded as winner for the 2023 Good Food Awards. This motivates us to work hard every day, and continue to search for great coffees to share with you all.

Guji is heavy with primary forest thanks to the Guji tribe, a part of Ethiopia’s vast and diverse Oromo nation, who have for generations organized to reduce mining and logging outfits in a struggle to conserve the land’s sacred canopy and soils. The biodiversity, climate, and ongoing preservation efforts have kept large parts of Guji feeling like prehistoric forest.

The Uraga district of Guji in particular can be a very long drive (or a few days’ walk) from the nearest trading centers of Gedeb or Dilla to the west. This distance has historically left many coffee farmers debilitated by lack of access to market, and cherry prices much less than neighboring Gedeo or Sidama zones. The gorgeous terroir of this area, blessed by some of the country’s healthiest biodiversity, risks being ruined in transit, or purchased for cheap and blended into lower grades due to the difficult geography.

This lot is fruit forward with strawberry, blueberry and black cherry notes. We hope you enjoy!",,64e5bdf82a0096c6f9935392,Blossom Coffee Roasters,https://blossomcoffeeroasters.com/,https://blossomcoffeeroasters.com/collections/blends,,,,12oz,,,,,,,,,,

Hunapu is the native Mayan name for the Agua Volcano that looms over the Antigua highlands. Luis Pedro Zelaya Zemora purchases only 100% bourbon from small farmers who grow on 1-5 acre parcels clinging to the side of this volcano. Zelaya's mill, Bella Vista, processes only the ripest red bourbon cherries. Lots are created through combining top quality day-lots from multiple producers. This method of combing lots creates some very complex profiles. Purchasing Hunapu supports smaller farmers that otherwise don't produce enough coffee to find customers to sell to directly.

César rakes parchment frequently to ensure even drying; it takes approximately 15 to 20 days for parchment to dry. Once dry, parchment is rested on his farm for 10 days and then moved to the Valle del Inca cooperative warehouses for 30 days before being transported to the dry mill and prepared for export.",Fall 2022,64e5bc4d2a0096c6f9935387,Roseline Coffee,https://roselinecoffee.com/,https://roselinecoffee.com/collections/coffees,,,,12OZ,,,,,,,,,,

In 1975, the “black frost” devastated plantations in Parana — at the time, the largest coffee-producing region in Brazil — while in western São Paulo, coffee plantations were struggling against an intense nematodes infestation. These two events brought Brazil’s coffee industry to its knees. Farmers set out in search of new areas to develop and arrived in Cerrado — an underdeveloped area with poor, acidic soil — just as a government effort was underway to understand the science of Cerrado’s soil and whether it might someday be a major food producer. Simple, inexpensive solutions wound up being effective, and coffee plants adapted well to Cerrado’s well-defined climate. Its warm temperatures, intense sunlight and dry winters aligned perfectly with the harvest, which demands dry weather. Today, coffee is grown here in 55 towns and across 210,000 hectares. Cerrado is also one of the most biodiverse and complex regions on earth. The area is home to roughly 5% of all species on earth.",,64e5bb7c2a0096c6f993537e,Groundswell,https://groundswellcoffeeroasters.com,https://groundswellcoffeeroasters.com/collections/all-beans,,,,12oz,,,,,,,,,,

During the harvest season, Maria Elsi both supervises and participates in the cherry collection. As the cherry comes in from the field, she begins the post-collection processing. She de-pulps and ferments the beans for 12 to 14 hours. Experience has taught Maria Elsi that in Buesaco, the beans are dried in two stages, due to the relatively high humidity: First for just three hours on a patio and then for four days on raised beds.

A washed coffee from high in the Peruvian Andes, this lot offers a profile of balanced acidity played with gentle yet intricate fruit sweetness.

Dionisio grows a mix of bourbon and caturra varietals on his family's six hectare farm Agua Cristalina. Grown at 1825 meters above sea level, cool night time low temperatures and mild day time highs encourage a long growing cycle. This packs each cherry full of rich sugars and dense nutrients. After being picked by Dioniso and a team of six pickers, the cherries are fermented for 24 hours before being washed and dried on beds for 20-24 days. This careful processing results in a coffee that is exceptionally crisp and structured, with distinct notes of both varietal and origin.

Dionisio Pintado's hard work, thoughtful attention and deep base of knowledge combine to deliver a coffee that highlights the finest qualities that Peruvian coffees have. When brewed, we taste kumquat, peach blush, and lime zest.",,64e5bb3b2a0096c6f993537d,Metric Coffee,https://metriccoffee.com/,https://metriccoffee.com/collections/featured-products,,,,10.5 oz,,,,,,,,,,

On our way to visit producer Nelson Chaves, we learned that Carlos goes beyond his role as a Regional Parchment Buyer for the local cooperative and pulls double duty as a producer.

His Farm Santa Ana sits at 2,072 meters above sea level in the Tasnaque Region of Yacuanquer, Colombia. Carlos grows an even mixture of Yellow and Red Caturra. Tasnaque vereda is perched on the southern slope of the Galeras stratovolcano, a central fixture in this part of the Nariño. Galeras’ continuous activity plays a significant role in the region’s terroir. Carlos’s farm sits just a stone throw away from his beautiful home on rocky volcanic soil, rich with minerals. Prime sunlight and ample cloud coverage which promotes slower cherry maturation.

He took notes based on positive processing from Honduras by Benjamin Paz. Carlos adapted Paz’s techniques, honey processing part of his lot and natural processing another, with the natural lot standing out. This lot underwent dry aerobic fermentation for 48 hours, before being placed on raised beds to dry. The result is a complex flavor on the palate with intense fruity notes of blueberry and passion fruit, accompanied by mango sweetness and a peach-like acidity",,64e5bb3b2a0096c6f993537d,Metric Coffee,https://metriccoffee.com/,https://metriccoffee.com/collections/featured-products,,,,8 oz,,,,,,,,,,

Khan is an inspiring artist that is creating truly unique designs in an ever expanding digital platform. Khan has built and inspired a community based on positivity and streams his creation process live on twitch.tv

The roast is a blend of coffees from Brazil and Java, both roasted to separate profiles but pair to create a silky smooth and naturally sweet cup. Notes of spiced cacao can be found and enhanced by the caramel and silky finish. The perfect roast to Khanquer the Day!

As a roaster and a consultant over the past nineteen years, Scott Rao has had the opportunity to cup and view the roast data for each of more than 20,000 batches roasted on a variety of machines by various methods. About five years ago, he spent several days poring over reams of roast data in an attempt to find the common elements in the best batches I’d ever tasted.* To be clear, I’m not refer-ring to “really good” batches. I focused only on the data from batches so special that I could “taste” them in my memory months or years after physically tasting them. That effort yielded what I think of as the “commandments of roasting.”

This book is both for the seasoned roast master looking for more information on common criteria that affect a roasts but also for those looking to get into roasting.

My coffee library was chock-full of colorful descriptions of brewing styles, growing regions, and recipes, with a few almost-unreadable scientific books mixed in. I would have traded in all of those books for one serious, practical book with relevant information about making great coffee in a café. Fourteen years later, I still haven't found that book.

Through this journey, we've found some fantastic coffee experiences and always wished we could share them with our customers. These unique coffees are mostly produced from 'nano-lots', which are small sections of a farm that are carefully cultivated to produce new varietals or experimental cup profiles and are among the most exclusive coffee beans in the world. The farmers and agronomists responsible for these nano-lots meticulously monitor every aspect of the growing process, from seedling to harvest, to ensure that the resulting beans are of the highest quality and able to be replicated. These small lots are often separated from the rest of the farm and processed using experimental techniques, such as prolonged & unconventional fermentation or unique drying methods, in order to enhance the flavor profile of the coffee. As it can take sometimes 10 years to establish a new coffee variety on a farm for general production, there are times these gems are available for a small exclusive release as a production lot scales up. Due to their exceptional quality and limited availability, coffees like these are highly sought-after by coffee enthusiasts and connoisseurs. These coffee experiences offer a unique opportunity to taste some of the rarest and most exceptional coffees in the world. We've kept these coffees to ourselves in the past, using them for competitions, but with the Meridian project, we're excited to finally share these exquisite coffee experiences with those who truly appreciate and value exceptional coffee flavor profiles.",,64e5b9962a0096c6f9935377,Five Elephants Roastery,https://www.fiveelephant.com/,https://www.fiveelephant.com/collections/coffee,,,,125g,,,,,,,,,,

The cooperative was established through an NGO called Technoserve. They are located in Agaro, close to Jimma in the west of Ethiopia, known lately for very flavor-intense, floral, and spicy coffees with extraordinary complexity and uniqueness. Before these cooperatives were established, the farmers were mainly producing lower-grade naturals sold as Jimma Grade 5. The coffee cherries are chosen from smallholders with less than 3 hectares per farm. All coffees selected are grown around and above 1900 meters above sea level. The cooperative is using Penagos ecopulpers, which contributes to the coffee's brilliant clarity of cup, it is hardly fermented during processing. After pulping, the coffees are often soaked under clean water overnight before they are dried on raised tables.",,64e5b9962a0096c6f9935377,Five Elephants Roastery,https://www.fiveelephant.com/,https://www.fiveelephant.com/collections/coffee,,,,250g - Filter,,,,,,,,,,

Each year, the coffees produced at Finca El Majahual are not only really good, but also inspiring - with new processing techniques involved, and new social initiatives launched and supported by the premiums paid for the farm's lots.
Of this lot of Orange Bourbon, we'll be offering two different coffees this year - this filter roast, and an espresso roast.

As an experienced beekeeper, Mrs. Berretto had first-hand knowledge of the effects that chemicals have on farmlands and the lives they nurture. Setting her sights on establishing a fully organic farm, she completely transformed the property. Following a difficult period which resulted in poor yields, Mr. Barretto and Mr. Croce focused their efforts on cultivating healthy permaculture, which paid off big time. The success of the couple and their farm spread throughout the region, and the two became passionate ambassadors of sustainable, specialty grade coffee cultivation, empowering their neighbors and their community.

The name of the dry mill is derived from the Deri village and Fahmi, which is Faysel's first son. The area is known for its fertile red-brown soil and is shaded by Sudan teak trees and Ethiopian banana plants. Its coffee farms are situated at elevations ranging from 1900 - 2200 meters above sea level.

In Ethiopia, coffee is typically grown on small plots of land by farmers who also cultivate other crops, hence the name ""coffee gardens"". The ripe cherries are delivered to nearby washing stations, where they undergo sorting, weighing, and payment. It can be challenging to trace coffee back to individual farmers due to the blending of cherries into day lots. Coffee from a washing station typically comes from the same farmers in the area.

This particular lot stands out due to the extra attention paid to sorting and selecting the ripest cherries. The lot undergoes multiple sorting beyond the already top-grade 1 prep, ensuring only the highest quality beans make it into the final product. Additionally, farmers in this region grow their coffees without using fertilisers or pesticides, resulting in not only high-quality but also environmentally friendly coffee.",,64e5b9962a0096c6f9935377,Five Elephants Roastery,https://www.fiveelephant.com/,https://www.fiveelephant.com/collections/coffee,,,,250g - Filter,,,,,,,,,,

These drippers not only look stunning but also brew exceptional coffee.

Those who have known us for a while know we prefer flat bed coffee brewers, however, they often clog; not with the Origami! The Origami dripper has one large hole on the bottom of the brewer and fits Kalita filters perfectly resulting in the best of both worlds. If you like the normal Kalita Wave/Gino then you'll love this as you'll get consistent cups with even more clarity than ever before. 

Prefer cone filters? That's alright too as these brewers will accept V60 or other cone paper filters as well!

Available in two sizes, the Small fits Kalita 155 filters and the Medium fits Kalita 185 filters. 

Wooden/acrylic base is sold separately but NOT required for the dripper to function (it can just sit in your carafe). The acrylic base does force the dripper more level (less fussy) than the wooden version but both work similarly.

1 - The dripper is physically two separate pieces, both nigh indestructible for portability. The bases are interchangeable with a lot of personal flair (and every one is slightly different from each other).
2 - The flat bottom has a few different unique holes in it allowing for a much higher flow rate than a typical Kalita/Gino/Melitta etc.

During that time he also grew his own coffee and sold his cherries to the Duromina station, where his lots were mixed in with the others. To increase the quality of his product and receive a higher price he needed to increase the traceability and ability to control each step of the process. So instead of selling his coffee to the coop Nazimu started to process and export it himself. His land is directly neighbouring an ancient forest where coffee still grows wild. In the shadow of the old trees, Nazimu’s coffee cherries mature slower than they would if they were exposed to direct sunlight. This makes for a sweeter, brighter and more complex coffee.

The goal of this association is to share and promote good and respectful agricultural practices. To change the productivist agricultural model for a more sustainable and respectful to the land model.

By sharing knowledge, coffee farmers are able to produce higher quality coffee while maintaining a good yield and therefore increase their revenue and profit.

The Cauca region is located in the southwest of Colombia. Home to around 94000 coffee-producing families, it is the second major coffee-producing region in the country. The average farm is less than 3 hectares, with less than 1 hectare cultivated with coffee.

Thanks to particular environmental conditions (high plateau, stable climate, and volcanic soil) coffee from the Cauca region was awarded a Denomination of Origin in 2011.

This coffee is dominated by caramel and molasses flavor, with some malt syrup and dark chocolate aftertaste.

We recommend using this coffee for espresso based milk drinks.",,64e5b80e2a0096c6f9935370,Andersen & Maillard,https://www.andersenmaillard.dk/,https://www.andersenmaillard.dk/collections/coffee,,,,,,,250 g,,,,,,,

The cherries were hand-picked at peak ripeness. They are then floated to remove defects and pulped at the farm the following day. Maximiliano leaves them to dry-ferment for about 24h, after which the parchment is washed to remove the remaining mucilage. Once washed, the parchment is dried in a parabolic dryer, under shade, for 15 to 20 days.
This coffee is part of a sourcing program through an organization called Origin Coffee Lab. Their mission is to impact the lives of small shareholders through the Solidario project. In this program, they teach both financial and agricultural techniques to enable lasting change.

This cooperative operates three factories: Githembe, Kiganjo, and Ndundu. At Githembe, they pulp and wash the coffee beans before transporting them to Kiganjo for the drying process. Githembe is home to approximately 1500 active farmers who cultivate SL28, SL34 and Batian coffee varieties in clay loam soil.

Peaberry beans are characterized by their small size and dense texture, imparting a higher acidity to the coffee, distinguishing it from the general flavor profile found in the region. Kenyan peaberry lots are unique and typically in high demand, despite their limited availability.

Consistency in processing techniques is maintained across all three factories. Cherries undergo sorting before pulping, after which, dry fermentation period of 12-14 hours occurs. This is followed by washing and grading in channels. Subsequently, the coffee undergoes the drying phase on raised beds, typically taking 12-20 days depending on weather and rainfall.",,64e5b80e2a0096c6f9935370,Andersen & Maillard,https://www.andersenmaillard.dk/,https://www.andersenmaillard.dk/collections/coffee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The region is plentiful in water resources and provides excellent conditions for coffee with altitudes around 1000m and mild weather.

Current owner Aristides Botrel is the heir of a rich coffee growing tradition. In fact the Botrel family was among the first to plant coffee in these lands in the late 1800s.
As an Agronomic Engineer and raised in a farm, Aristides developed a deep understanding of the coffee plant, helping to push the limits in agricultural practices and performance, constantly modernizing the farm to keep up with the latest technologies available. Still nowadays he is responsible for overviewing all field operations and visits all coffee plots on a nearly daily basis.

From 2010, new emphasis has been given to post harvest, including new water milling facilities aiming to improve quality in a continuous and consistent manner. This has enabled Monjolo to broaden the array of coffees available and thus reach different international markets.",,64e5b80e2a0096c6f9935370,Andersen & Maillard,https://www.andersenmaillard.dk/,https://www.andersenmaillard.dk/collections/coffee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over 50% of the members of the cooperative grow coffee on land that is less than 10 Ha in size. All the coffees that are part of this blend are dried in static boxes. These are 1 m deep boxes with capacity for 15000 litre volume of cherry which equates to 25-30 bags of green coffee. The boxes have a vented grill at the bottom to allow for air to be circulated from below up through the drying coffee. There are two thermometers at different depths to ensure a safe temperature always below 40c. They are referred to as static due to the coffee remaining still in the boxes and not being turned or rotated during drying. After it is dried the coffee is then left to rest for approximately 1- 2 weeks before being milled.

When Devoción talks about freshness, we’re talking all the way from origin to cup. Roasting provides only half of coffee’s flavor, while mere freshness of the beans does the rest of the work. And yet, most coffee beans sit around for months, losing flavor every day. That’s why we do everything short of picking the cherry, and faster than anyone else.

This extreme logistical feat of controlling the entire production chain from the moment the beans leave the farm results in extremely vibrant flavor profiles without suffering any deterioration. La Roca is an outstanding example of the impact of freshness before roasting, with crisp and juicy notes of green apple and cherry, and unmistakable floral notes, making for a delightfully bright and complex cup.",,64e5b6ae2a0096c6f9935366,Devoción,https://www.devocion.com/,https://www.devocion.com/collections/coffee-1,,,,12 oz,,,,,,,,,,

Long awaited follow up to the ""True Story of Abner Jay"" LP. Abner Jay was a man who had a grand sweeping vision of what folk music was. In his lifetime his expression of what folk music could be encompassed some serious stylistic variations. Sometimes he was a one man band traveling troubadour playing an electric banjo, harmonica, & drums who tried to hoodwink audiences into believing that he was 150 years old & the standard bearer for authentic Americana. Sometimes he played in electric straight up R&B bands such as ""Koko Joe & the Jobhunters"".

Culled from a mix of Abners' 45's & LPs spanning the period 1964 - 1973, including Abner's first LP.

And from these first harvests of their Pink Bourbon, we can tell you that they're onto something.

Their meticulous picking and careful processing of this variety has resulted in one of the most dynamic, complex and exciting coffees from Colombia that we've had on our menu: chrysanthemum tea, plum, mango, dried apricot, browned butter with an elegant, integrated structure.

For many years, we have been working with our exporting partners and producers in Nueva Segovia to slow their coffee drying process and to dry their coffees on raised beds rather than on the traditional hot, black tarps on the ground. Slowly, we’ve seen a remarkable cup profile emerge from Dipilto: sweet, clean and dynamic. Politically, things in Nicaragua have been challenging to say the least. Many farmers have walked away from their established coffee farms and this year, there was a great deal of uncertainty about how we could support our farmers in Nicaragua. Once again, we are blessed to have Alejandro Valiente on the ground in El Salvador. He worked closely with Hipolito Morales, Guillermo Montenegro and Misael Olivera as they banded together and delivered their catuai, villalobos, and caturra varieties to the skilled hands of Manuel Rosales and his el Puma (dry mill). The coffees were dried slowly and processed carefully and the result is lovely: butterscotch, cherry and a heavy, long body.

Buena Vista is, in many ways, the pinnacle of what Luis Pedro and his family have been doing in Antigua for many decades now: running a coffee growing and processing operation with vast knowledge and an eye for the details. The Gravilea trees are pruned meticulously, the coffees are dried on raised beds, fresh tostadas are served just outside the cupping lab.

And lucky for us, many years ago, Luis Pedro and his father planted large new lots of gesha on Buena Vista that was seeded from nearby Finca Santa Clara’s blend of Malawi and Panama geshas. Although all geshas originate from Ethiopia, the different trajectory of these varieties makes for unique bean shape and size, as well as cup profile. This blended lot is showy and dense with syrupy notes of orange blossom honey, navel orange, medjool dates and carob. Once again, we bow in gratitude to the Zelayas for their careful shepherding, great care and brilliance in planting gesha on Buena Vista.",,64e5b6862a0096c6f9935365,Four Barrel Coffee,https://www.fourbarrelcoffee.com/,https://www.fourbarrelcoffee.com/collections/coffee,,,,12OZ,,,,,,,,,,

Most of the coffee trees on the farm were planted in the 1970s and still generate outstanding fruit.

This coffee comes straight out of Pitalito, Huila, where producer Willyan Rojas Zambrano and his wife, Maria Esther Lopez, produce exquisite coffees on their farm, La Montañita. It's not often that one coffee will stop the whole of Seven Seeds HQ in its tracks. Little was known of the Willyan Zambrano before we received a sample in late 2022, but we knew we had something special from the first cupping. The Willyan Zambrano is exceptional. We are not one for hyperboles here at Seeds, but this coffee is out of this world. Let's explain the mysterious varietal ""Pink Bourbon"". It is a natural mutation between the Red and Yellow Bourbon that first became prominent in the Huila region. As it is a natural hybridization, the varietal is recessive and unstable. Without careful cultivation by farmers, Pink Bourbon can be hard to produce consistently. Given this, information on this coffee's history varies, and the future of its production is unclear. One thing is sure: a cup of Pink Bourbon is unique, complex and outstanding. A focus for the Seven Seeds sourcing team in 2023 was to reestablish our presence with producers in Colombia, aiming to strengthen existing relationships and identify producers with whom we could establish long-term exclusive partnerships.

The microclimates and soil in this region are perfect for growing traditional varieties like Caturra, Typica, and Bourbon, always some of our favourites on the cupping table. El Conjuro is produced by around 60 producers from this region.
El Conjuro is grown with great care and expertise. The coffee is processed and dried at farm level, then separated into similar quality grades with matching flavour profiles before finally being shipped to us in Melbourne. It’s the second year we’ve committed to this particular group of producers. In 2022 we took a punt and initially roasted the El Conjuro for our espresso menu. We were so impressed with its landed quality we flipped it to filter for its final weeks. It was no surprise when it blew the socks off our team and was an absolute crowd favourite. This year will be no different.
The story of Cerro Conjuro says that a couple of decades ago, some missionaries came to the community, bringing with them two crucifixes. One was placed on top of the Cerro Conjuro, and the other was placed at the entrance to the community of Chotantli to protect them from plagues and other bad things. Every year in May, they celebrate their faith by climbing the Cerro Conjuro, followed by eating, drinking, and dancing.",May to November,64e5b5df2a0096c6f9935361,Seven Seeds,https://sevenseeds.com.au/,https://sevenseeds.com.au/collections/coffee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He picks only the ripest cherries, then floats the fruit in water to separate any foreign matter and less dense cherries. Whole cherries ferment for 12 hours in Grainpro bags before pulping and fermenting for a further 36 - 40 hours to breakdown the mucilage. Finally, the coffee is washed and taken to raised drying beds, where it will stay for 12 - 18 days, depending on climatic conditions. The result is an exquisite example of the coffee offered by Northern Peru. This high-quality micro-lot comprises 100% Caturra - one of our favourites for producing a clean and vibrant cup when grown and processed well.

Caturra is a natural mutation of the Bourbon variety, discovered on a plantation in Minas Gerais, Brazil, in the early 1900s. Caturra has a single-gene mutation that causes the plant to grow smaller. Breeders were initially interested in Caturra’s small size, allowing plants to be placed closer together, and its closely spaced secondary branches, which enable it to produce more fruit in the same space. The variety was never officially released in Brazil but has become one of Central America’s most economically important coffees, to the extent that it is often used as a benchmark against testing new cultivars. Caturra is known for being one of the parents of the Catimor family and the leaf-rust-resistant Castillo variety.",May to November,64e5b5df2a0096c6f9935361,Seven Seeds,https://sevenseeds.com.au/,https://sevenseeds.com.au/collections/coffee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, when this varietal is grown at altitude and processed well, it shows true colours with naturally vibrant, clean, complex & aromatic characteristics. In recent years, Java has made its way onto a small number of specialty roasters’ shelves as curious green buyers realise the potential of this historic variety when grown in ideal conditions.

This year Seven Seeds celebrates our 8th year of direct trade with Mariana & her team, one of five roasters in the world to hold this relationship. It’s something we savour and feel incredibly privileged to have. This highly regarded Geisha varietal has a track record of selling out within hours of release, so get in quick to avoid disappointment. The Geisha variety needs little introduction in the modern world of specialty coffee. In recent years it has been responsible for unprecedented success in multiple Cup of Excellence competitions, fetching some of the highest prices at auction ever recorded. It has also driven numerous winning presentations at top-level barista comps with its delicate florals, soft tropicals, and stunning tea-like qualities. There is no denying that when grown at altitude and processed well, Geisha will blow anything else clean off the cupping table. This year’s release from Finca Takesi is no exception. As usual, we’re in good company as one of only a handful of roasters worldwide with access to this stunning lot and the only roaster in Australia.

Parchment is transferred to raised beds where it sundries for 7 to 21 days, depending on weather conditions. Even drying is ensured by regular turning of the parchment.

Progressive cultivation practices such as shade plantation and innovative drying processes create new and exciting flavours.

This naturally processed Geisha variety from Santuario Sul appears for the first time here at Seven Seeds. Luiz Paulo keeps his post-harvest drying techniques extremely controlled, imparting minimal additional flavours to this highly regarded and sought-after varietal. The results? Rich, comforting texture, fresh fruit acidity, and a squeaky clean finish with delicate florals.

This lot has supercharged floral notes with an unexpectedly delicate finish. It leaves no doubt this will be one of our favourite coffees of the year.
In March this year, our head of procurement, Ryan, had the fantastic opportunity to travel to Jimma and spend the day with Kefyalew, traversing the countryside, visiting his wet mill and meeting the producers in the area he works with. Recent changes to export legislation in the Ethiopian coffee industry have allowed wet mill owners like Kefyalew to export the coffee they purchase and process from local producers.

While the Blue Orchid blend does change frequently, we try to maintain a sweet, full-bodied, chocolate and caramel flavor profile by using Central and South American coffees specifically chosen for those qualities. This is great tasting comfort coffee, and is a well-rounded crowd pleaser, especially if some of that crowd likes cream in their cup, or is still making the transition from darker roast profiles into specialty coffee. We love intense floral aromatics, but some mornings we just want the chocolate, toffee, and a bit of milk in our mug, and for those days, Blue Orchid is our go-to.

We're always excited to roast the goods from CoopeDota because the coffee is tasty, and the group has always been a sustainability leader in Costa Rica. In 2011 the cooperative produced the world's first certified carbon-neutral coffee, and is known for its work to reduce both its carbon and water footprints.  CoopeDota washes all of its coffees using an Eco-Pulper - a machine that uses significantly less water to remove the coffee's fruit and mucilage from the bean. While it's not necessary with this machine, the cooperative does give its microlots a chance to ferment before washing, which tends to boost complexity.

2023 Santa Maria has a lot going for it - milk-friendly hazelnut and pie crust flavors, balanced green apple and citrus brightness, and a touch of stone fruit.

Year 6 of Sipi, year 5 of Sipi Nat, and we've been looking forward to this for a few months now. It rivals some of our favorites from Ethiopia, but thanks in part to different coffee varieties (SL28 and SL34, most famous in Kenya), this one carries a bit more chocolate and body.

Sipi Falls is one of Uganda's most famous landmarks, and much of the country's best coffee comes from the region. Huck specifically seeks out the coffees from Gamatui, the highest altitude community that delivers coffee to the Sipi Falls Washing Station in the town of Chema. That high altitude, combined with Sipi Falls Washing Station's impressive attention to detail, yields complex, delicious, and juicy goodness in the cup.

Uganda is an up-and-coming coffee-producing country, but the coffees from Sipi Falls and Gamatui village have quickly become coffees we look forward to each year. We’re stoked to showcase the continual improvements in Ugandan coffee, but more importantly, we’re just stoked to have this coffee in our mugs.

This year's Mazateca is balanced and sweet, with fresh fig fruitiness, pastry and dulce de leche sweetness, blood orange-like brightness, and a creamy body. Definitely a great, traditional coffee to pair with milk, but also plenty of complexity for those of us who like to drink it black.

Despite being one of the more economically-developed countries in Latin America and having some amazing coffee-growing terrain, Mexico is a tough place to source excellent coffee. In powerhouses like Colombia, Brazil, Guatemala, Ethiopia, and Kenya, the government often takes a keen interest in developing the coffee sector. In Mexico, there's little to no government-involvement, so producers have little access to agronomic training and little support getting to market, despite having amazing potential.

Moreover, Oaxaca's Sierra Mazateca is one of the more remote coffee-growing regions of the world, and far from an easy place to work. Spanish takes a back seat to Mayan dialects, and while the coffees can be exceptional, small farms often produce so little coffee that it's hard to justify exporting. Luckily, Frida Mendoza, her company Terra Coffeas, and our import partners Osito Coffee put in the work, traveling to meet smallholder farmers and building great-tasting coffees from multiple tiny, tiny nanolots. Our coffee comes from several of these smaller farms in the Sierra Mazateca.

Creamy, sweet, and approachable, with brightness and fig-like fruitiness to keep things lively, this is a great option for folks who love easy-drinking Latin American coffee!",null,64e5b55e2a0096c6f993535f,Huckleberry Roasters,https://huckleberryroasters.com/,https://huckleberryroasters.com/collections/frontpage,,,,12 OZ,,,,,,,,,,

The decaffeination process is produced at origin and helps local coffee communities grow unlike other popular decaffeination methods. This process taking place at origin also greatly helps reduce our carbon footprint by removing the need to send the coffee to a decaffeination facility (typically in a different country!) Our Colombian E.A. (ethyl acetate) decaf offering is special in more ways than one however: Secondly, they're cupped specifically for their quality and sourced by single-origin, either region or farm. We call them Decaf De Caña because they're custom decaffeinated in Colombia, using a special, natural process that utilizes a solvent of ethyl acetate, which can be derived from fermented sugar. Our importing partner has personally visited the decaffeination plant several times, and was impressed by the process as well as the quality in the cup! The process works by soaking green coffee in a solution of E.A., which bonds to the salts of chlorogenic acid in the coffee and allows for the removal of caffeine. The coffee is removed from the solvent and steamed at low pressure to remove the E.A. compounds, and the finished product retains its flavor integrity but contains almost no caffeine at all. (The beans will contain a maximum of 0.01–0.03% caffeine.)",,64e5b5362a0096c6f993535d,Coffee Manufactory,https://www.coffeemanufactory.com/,https://www.coffeemanufactory.com/collections/coffee,,,,12oz,,,,,,,,,,

Our Anaerobico Cordillera de Fuego comes from producer Luis Eduardo Campos, a Costa Rican coffee farmer who is constantly looking for new and innovative ways to improve his coffee production. The flavors and attributes in this coffee can be attributed to its special anaerobic processing method.

The Anaerobic process starts with handpicked, mature coffee cherries that have a Brix degree (a measurement of sugar content) near 26. The coffee is de-pulped and placed in stainless steel tanks with all its mucilage. As the fermentation begins, oxygen, decreases and carbon dioxide increases in the fermentation tank. The coffee develops in a unique mix of lactic acid and malic acid, which contributes to the coffee's complex flavor. Once ready, the coffee is 100% sun-dried.",,64e5b4fa2a0096c6f993535b,Bar Nine,https://barnine.us/,https://barnine.us/collections/coffee,,,,250g,,,,,,,,,,

It is a complex cup that we recommend spending a little time with when sipping, the experience is worth it. Like a great wine, letting it open as it cools will yield wonderful results.

This region is perfect for growing high quality coffees, with limestone soils, high altitudes, cold nights and hot days, but production has been devastated by climate change. Luckily, Matias is a founding member of Asociación Integral Agrícola Sostenible Toneca-Toneca Sustainable Agricultural Association (ASIAST), a local association that has not just worked hard to improve coffee quality and sell microlots to specialty coffee buyers, but also introduce sustainable farming practices.

Matias’ farm has introduced rainwater harvesting, composting systems, and planted native shade and fruit trees, all to ensure that his remote farm can remain economically and agriculturally viable. His efforts provide an excellent model on how specialty coffee production can provide a bulwark against climate change and maintain producers’ livelihoods through worsening conditions.

The end result from all the hard work is a delightful coffee, with stone fruit flavors and the classic Guatemalan nougat sweetness that makes these coffees so enjoyable.",,64e5b4562a0096c6f9935359,Elm Coffee Roasters,https://elmcoffeeroasters.com/,https://elmcoffeeroasters.com/collections/coffee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cooperative is made up of 1,100 active members, averaging around 1 hectare of land, and growing tea, corn, bananas, macadamia and eucalyptus in addition to coffee.

Like the vast majority of Kenyan coffee, Gatirima receives many different smallholder farmers’ crops, usually only enough to fill a couple bags, then processes and sells it all together as daylots, as a cooperative effort. Because of Kenyan coffee’s unique material conditions, terroir’s importance is much more subdued, and processing plays the main role in coffee quality.

As a result, nowhere in the world is as meticulous in producing clean coffee as Kenya. Almost all factories utilize a “72 hour process,” a process with an additional third stage that uses fresh water to remove any remaining fruit. The basic method is that the cherry is mechanically depulped before undergoing an initial 24 hour ferment, then the coffee is washed and fermented again without water for 12-24 hours, before the final washing and soaking in tanks for 12-18 additional hours. After this, the coffee is transferred to drying beds, where they will be left for 8-12 days to reach optimal moisture content. At the end of this process, you are left with an immaculate coffee, with the only flavors being imparted at the farm or in the fermentation tanks.",,64e5b4562a0096c6f9935359,Elm Coffee Roasters,https://elmcoffeeroasters.com/,https://elmcoffeeroasters.com/collections/coffee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This attention to coffee quality from a young age has led to years of experimentation to achieve his ideal cup profile, resulting in his unique processing protocol.

His process begins with a 24-48 hour cherry ferment, after which he floats the cherry to homogenize the temperature, then de-pulps it before adding it to sealed plastic bags for an anaerobic fermentation stage. Vergara works with a microbiology lab to reproduce the microorganisms present on each variety of cherry he grows, which he adds to the coffee during the anaerobic ferment, allowing them to push out any other microbes from propagating that may introduce unwanted flavors.

Unlike anything on the market, the coffees in our Flash Brew Oatmilk Lattes are meticulously sourced by our coffee buying team from Ethiopia and Southern Colombia. The blend and roast draws inspiration from a classic espresso profile which is exactly what this drink calls for - it is a latte, after all! Though the exact makeup of coffee components may shift throughout the season, the end goal will always remain consistent with deep and structured tasting notes of bakers' chocolate, honey, and hazelnut.

We source our honey for this latte from coffee blossom flowers on a farm in Mexico. We are proud to be part of this influential cycle.

Every year when we visit Honduras on origin trips, we are absolutely blown away by the vast majority of coffees being grown in the Santa Barbara region. We are grateful to have so many opportunities to connect at farmelevel, share stories with our partners, and cup through countless coffees from each year’s harvest. As a part of our farmlevel initiative we are committed to investing in coffee producing communities. A major factor in that investment is committing to buying coffees from our direct-trade partners year after year. While our partners are facing drastic and challenging shifts in producing coffee, this single origin offering is an effort to support producers whose harvests have been greatly affected by unprecedented weather conditions hurting their harvest. Yojoa is the name of the largest lake in Honduras, situated at the base of Santa Barbara. Naming a coffee after this lake encapsulates the admiration and appreciation we have for our partners in this area.

The heavier paper promotes a slower brew-flow, encouraging better extraction and ultimately a sweeter, well-developed brew. The quality of the paper is such that without a pre-rinse, these filters impart less paper-filter taste than most filters WITH a pre-rinse.

José’s coffee was initially brought to our attention at Colombia’s Cup of Excellence competitions in 2020 and 2021, where he won 6th and 5th place respectively. This lot is what José calls the “Ají” varietal, which is the Spanish word for chili pepper. José named it after noticing the spicy smell of its cherries. These delicate chili pepper-like qualities are also subtly present in the cup, giving this coffee a truly one-of-a-kind flavor.

All the interest piqued by this obscure coffee led Cup of Excellence to have it tested by RD2 Vision, a coffee research and development company based in France. It was determined that “Ají” is a newly-discovered Ethiopia Landrace Heirloom Varietal—meaning it’s a previously unknown, wild-varietal coffee from Ethiopia. Landrace plants are grown from seeds that have not been systematically selected or hybridized by plant breeders. With this coffee, you have the rare chance to taste a pure Ethiopian Landrace coffee, something that rarely has ever happened outside of Ethiopia.",,64e5b3aa2a0096c6f9935352,Olympia Coffee Roasting,https://www.olympiacoffee.com/,https://www.olympiacoffee.com/collections/coffee,,,,12 oz,,,,,,,,,,

Before being exported, the coffee undergoes a meticulous screening process using various filters to grade the beans based on their size. These particular beans are classified as ""peaberrries,"" the smallest size in Kenya.

Peaberries are the result of an uncommon phenomenon: when a coffee cherry develops only one seed instead of the usual two. This rarity contributes to the distinct characteristics of these beans. Some coffee enthusiasts find that the single seed in a peaberry allows it to absorb more concentrated nutrients, yielding heightened sweetness and flavor.",,64e5b3aa2a0096c6f9935352,Olympia Coffee Roasting,https://www.olympiacoffee.com/,https://www.olympiacoffee.com/collections/coffee,,,,12 oz,,,,,,,,,,

Working with the Catuai varietal, he decided to experiment with natural processing — a challenging technique in a region with high humidity and low temperatures. Yet his determination to enhance the value of his coffee and benefit his family motivated him to take the risk.

Antonio's pursuit of excellence led him to construct a solar dryer, an ingenious solution that shields the coffee from unpredictable weather while simultaneously raising the drying temperature. The results speak for themselves: a remarkable coffee with an enchantingly fruity intensity that sets it apart from the rest.

Music that is both cosmic in its spectrum and rooted in the rhythms of the Earth is exceedingly rare, yet that is exactly the union achieved by Ras Michael (Dadawah) on Peace and Love, his seminal 1974 record of ghostly Nyabinghi devotionals. The dominant sounds are heady and psychadelic, hypnotic and mysterious; Dadawah’s voice, always warm, glides across intricate constellations of lush, meditative bass, piano and lead guitar. But the waves of echo that wash over the music suggest that below the surface is something dark and unknown. The groove throughout runs deep, lulling the listener into a concealed, liminal state. Out of this darkness, though, comes Dadawah’s bright and hopeful celebrations of life and love, leading us all back to the path to Zion—back to where we are all supposed to be.

Another Little Tandem staple from way back in the day. This album was originally given to me by my good friend and coffee expert Dillon Edwards back when were both honing our coffee skills at Blue Bottle Coffee. Dillon had 2 copies for some reason and gave me his extra. In return I gave him my extra copy of Louis’Hello Dolly. I think I got the better end of the deal for this record is a true masterpiece. Full of stories, life lessons and and heavy themes like “Cocaine”, “Vietnam” and “The Reason Young People Use Drugs”, one or 2 copies of this record belong in every collection.

We quickly recognized that its rhythms, razor thin guitar playing and ethereal harmonies would make this a great winter record for the subscribers. It could be a real nice respite from what will likely be dark times, we thought back in July. Well, here I am writing this hours after the president's supporters have overrun the Capital. Dark times, indeed. So, what do we need while we are still less than half way through this god awful winter?  What we need are these uplifting equatorial tunes from Pedro Lima! Born in São Tomé and Principe in 1944 while the island was still a Portugeuese colony. He was known as the ""people's voice of the island"" because of his vocal support for the island nation's dependence which was established in 1975. Pedro Lima also fathered 27 children! São Tomé and Principe is famous for its coffee and mind blowingly beautiful and full of striking rock formations. Look it up! It's no surprise that the musicians making this music were surrounded by such natural beauty. Every January I try to pick an album that sets a new tone for the year - to free the mind of the past and ready to look ahead.  Hopefully this gem puts you in a good mindset to handle 2021. It's probably going to be a weird one! -Will Pratt 1/6/21",,64e5b3702a0096c6f9935350,Tandem Coffee Roasters,https://www.tandemcoffee.com/,https://www.tandemcoffee.com/collections/coffees#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's the same great kettle with an intuitive, steady pour from Stagg's precision pour spout but with the added electric variable temperature control that will let you brew with greater ease and more control over every variable.
Because wood is a natural product it is prone to drying and warping. Wood components that are exposed to high heat and moisture, such as the lid pull and handle, may eventually dry out and crack (like repeatedly putting a cutting board in a dishwasher). To prevent this, we recommend periodically applying mineral oil to the lid pull & handle once per month - and buffing with a soft cloth. It’s also good practice to do this any time you notice the wood feeling especially dry.

""This issue is important to me because I got to celebrate and honor a product that has changed my life for the better. Coffee has brought so many incredible people into my life and this issue proved that 10 times over.

I’m excited for Issue 10 to be released to the world because it genuinely shows and celebrates magic that can be found within the coffee industry; from the people that farm, to the people that make, to the people that consume. This issue is filled with dreams past, present and future and I’m excited for readers to experience them first hand.""
All sales from this issue through the month of September will go to the artists in the zine.

To combat poverty and support women's coffees in Burundi, in 2019 RGC Coffee established a social partnership with Phyllis Johnson of BD Imports and Angèle Ciza of Kalico (Kahawa Link Company). The resulting coffees not only represent the quality Burundi has to offer, but also illustrate the leadership and perseverance of Angèle Ciza, whose work has uplifted thousands of farmers and continues to be a source of inspiration, especially for women—80% of Kalico's partner farms are owned or managed by women. Butihinda Washing Station is part of a network of seven wet mills owned and operated by Kalico that are scattered among two northeastern provinces, Kirundo and Muyinga. The microclimate of the hills that surround these washing stations is softened by the high density of rivers that wind through the region. Butihinda Washing Station was built in 1992 and is located at 1,700 meters in altitude. The washing station uses water source from Rushombo Mountain at 2,000 meters to process the cherries of approximately 1,400 smallholder producers.

Coffee People Zine / Issue 11 holds space for The Longest Night - whether in the literal sense (it is Winter Solstice, after all) or a more figurative sense (depression, anxiety, joblessness, isolation, this whole f*cking year). The Longest Night is a recognition that things are shitty and hard and sometimes we're not alright. And still we focus on self care, we take care of our mental health, we connect however we can, and we hold on until the light comes back.

BONUS CONTENT: This issue is a 2-in-1 zine, sharing space with Glitter People Zine, class of 2020. This is a 20-page extra zine at the back of this issue, featuring bios, profiles, and artwork of everyone who participated in Glitter Cat bootcamps for the 2020 season.

Painting, photography, poetry, short stories, illustrations, music, and other work by brilliant artists in the coffee industry.

The Story
Ana Maria Ortega grew up with bees. Her father lovingly tended the apiary, which was close to the house. She recalls consuming the sticky, rich honeycomb as much as inhaling the intoxicating fragrance of coffee blossoms. 
But when Ana Maria was just seventeen, her parents died tragically. The farm was hers, and she poured her grief into running Finca Los Angeles, waking up before dawn to pick and process cherries, raking in her parchment after dark. But the bees floundered. The hives nearly died out as Ana Maria had no idea how to care for them.

Through years of hard lessons and support from neighbors, she learned how to successfully partner with both coffee plants and bees. Now, Ana Maria highlights these challenges as catalysts for her growth into the leader she is today. Aside from cultivating excellent coffee at Finca Los Angeles, Ana Maria Ortega is proud to share her delicious honey.",,64e5b2c62a0096c6f993534b,PT's Coffee,https://www.ptscoffee.com/,https://www.ptscoffee.com/collections/coffee,,,,12oz,,,,,,,,,,

Monte Grande is the name of an archaeological site located in the province of Jaen in the department of Cajamarca. A ceremonial temple there, with rocks arranged in a spiral shape, dates back more than 5,000 years.

Research that began in 2009 discovered that this site was part of a culture that developed on the border between Peru and Ecuador and extended into both countries. The researchers in both Ecuador and Peru want to build a binational touristic archaeological park that shows the uniqueness of this culture that existed more than 5,000 years ago.

Today, there is a group of farmers that grow coffee in the highlands that surround Monte Grande. They are committed to preserving their culture and history as well as protecting their environment and lands.",,64e5b2c62a0096c6f993534b,PT's Coffee,https://www.ptscoffee.com/,https://www.ptscoffee.com/collections/coffee,,,,12oz,,,,,,,,,,

Cascara is the husk of our favorite fruit, the coffee cherry. Literally meaning “peel” or “skin” in Spanish, cascara is collected and often tossed out after the seeds (coffee beans!) are removed from the fruit. But it doesn't have to be wasted!

Packed with polyphenols and antioxidants (more than superfoods like blueberries and pomegranates!), these coffee husks can be brewed much like a tea, creating a delicious and healthy beverage!

When brewed, cascara has a slightly sweet and refreshingly tart flavor with notes of hibiscus, molasses, and dried fruit. And with less than a quarter of the caffeine content of coffee, it’s a perfect pick-me-up for any time of day.

We source the highest-quality cascara for our iced cascara tea thanks to our partners at Huskwell!

ALOE: We love Aloe Vera! It’s the first ingredient for a reason—long known to calm and soothe even the most sunburned skin.
SPEARMINT: Just think of this as Peppermint's gentle friend—providing a soft cooling effect while its antioxidant properties leave your skin refreshed and revitalized.
EUCALYPTUS: Eucalyptus is known for its ability to soothe, and is often used in aromatherapy. We added it to Sunday Spray because we love its fresh scent and the refreshing cool it provides.
PRICKLY PEAR: We like to think of this as a hydrating powerhouse! Prickly Pear is packed with moisturizing Vitamin E and restorative oils.
CUCUMBER: Cucumber is able to prevent water loss from the skin thanks to the presence of ascorbic and caffeic acid—leaving you naturally hydrated.",,64e5b21d2a0096c6f9935344,Sightsee Coffee,https://www.sightseeshop.com/,https://www.sightseeshop.com/collections/coffee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Space Invaders characters you see in cities now world-wide are the work of one French-born “urban artist” who goes simply by “Invader.” He was born in 1969. Historical record indicates that his first installation went up in 1990 but it wasn't until 1998 - at the age of nearly 30 - that the true invasion of Paris began. That means, contrary to popular belief, street art is not solely the domain of punk kids. In fact, Invader has continued to delight keen eyes world-wide with his work on into his now 50's. These notebooks are a small tribute to that spirit of eternal playfulness. Incidentally, Joel has spotted dozens of Invaders across 6 cities, 4 countries, and two continents...but who's counting?",,64e5b21d2a0096c6f9935344,Sightsee Coffee,https://www.sightseeshop.com/,https://www.sightseeshop.com/collections/coffee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Featuring more than 120 beautiful color images plus an interview with the artist, LOCALS ONLY is the perfect way to bring that counterculture '70s skater vibe home with you.

About the book:
One afternoon in 1975, a young photographer named Hugh Holland drove up Laurel Canyon Boulevard in Los Angeles and encountered skateboarders carving up the drainage ditches along the side of the canyon. Immediately transfixed by their grace and athleticism, he knew he had found an amazing subject. Although not a skateboarder himself, for the next three years Holland never tired of documenting skateboarders surfing the streets of Los Angeles, parts of the San Fernando Valley, Venice Beach, and as far away as San Francisco and Baja California, Mexico.

During the mid-1970s, Southern California was experiencing a serious drought, leaving an abundance of empty swimming pools available for trespassing skateboarders to practice their tricks. From these suburban backyard haunts to the asphalt streets that connected them, this was the place that created the legendary Dogtown and Z-Boys skateboarders. With their requisite bleached blonde hair, tanned bodies, tube socks and Vans, these young outsiders are masterfully captured against a sometimes harsh but always sunny Southern California landscape in LOCALS ONLY.",,64e5b21d2a0096c6f9935344,Sightsee Coffee,https://www.sightseeshop.com/,https://www.sightseeshop.com/collections/coffee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this issue, you'll find stories and stunning photography highlighting Arne JinAn Wong, Luana Froiseth, Mario Ordoñez-Calderón, Beau Cram, Ming Nomchong, Luis Fernando Torres, Moana Jones Wong and more.

The cover features Beau Cram, photographed by Tom Pearsall, and Australian wood butcher and surf stylist who is profiled in this Issue. Emocean first met Beau in Ventura and were charmed by his humility, total genuine stoke, and insane style and energy in the water.

An excerpt from Issue 05:

“For over three thousand years, my people have been connected to water through all mediums. From ceremonies conducted in cenotes to the canoes that carried the Maya up and down the coastlines of present day Yucatán, Campeche, and Quintana Roo, water has been celebrated and held sacred since the beginning. It all starts making sense now as I answer the call of the ocean and return to these teal waters I was made from. As I slow down and look around at the pieces that have fallen into place along my life path, they’ve all led me here to realize… I am living the dream my younger self had.” -Mario Ordoñez-Calderón

We roast small batches on Loring machines around the world, so our coffee tastes not only luminous, but reliably consistent, from Tokyo to New York.",,64e5b2492a0096c6f9935346,Blue Bottle Coffee,https://bluebottlecoffee.com/,https://bluebottlecoffee.com/us/eng/shop/coffee,,,,12OZ,,,,,,,,,,

Rising costs and and inconsistency in freight channels meant that our source for Swiss Water Process decaffeinated coffee was increasingly unreliable due to the amount of transport required to get it to our roasting facility.

Like many roasters, we began sourcing what is commonly referred to as “Sugar Cane Process” decaf because it is much more readily available, and tends to produce a much more complex cup of coffee more similar in profile to our caffeinated offerings.

We’ve had several customers ask about the change, so we wanted to provide a little bit more information on the process. The process is also known as Ethyl Acetate (E.A.) decaffeination. Ethyl Acetate is a naturally occurring ester present in a number of fruits as well as during the fermentation stage of processing sugar cane into granulated sugar. This natural ester acts as a solvent that bonds naturally to caffeine molecules, so coffee seeds are steamed and soaked in a solution of water and ethyl acetate until no caffeine is detectable, then the coffee seeds are rinsed until there are no remaining traces of ethyl acetate and dried to prepare for export.

Because the E.A. process can be done in the country of origin, E.A. decaf supply is not as dramatically impacted by disruptions in shipping lane traffic or increases in freight costs.

Some people considered Black Dog a protector - a benevolent watchman - others viewed him as a scourge that needed to be captured and put down. Everyone agrees he was a wild, free-spirit that avoided capture or domestication despite countless attempts by city animal control and a number of residents of the neighborhoods he roamed. Writer, Mark Holmberg, once described Black Dog this way: 'Black Dog treats humans as if they were fire, getting close enough for warmth - even occasionally licking the feet of children - but never allowing himself to be touched.'

The mutation is unique in that it is terminal — meaning it did not continue to evolve further into new varieties with the exception of manmade cultivars using Maragogype stock. As you can see, Maragogype’s definitive characteristic is its size, sometimes two to three times the size of other coffee varieties. Maragogype is also far less dense which makes it a challenging coffee to roast.

Since our first introduction to Manuel’s coffee was in 2017, we got to pay a visit to him at his farm in 2018 and a year later, Manuel came to visit us in Virginia. This was during the construction of our Broad Street Cafe when studs were still showing and everything was covered in dust.

After working in construction in Georgia for a few years in his 20s, Manuel returned to Marcala to take over his father’s coffee farm and has spent years reworking and innovating ways to make the whole farm productive. The two major themes of Concepcion are biodiversity and sustainability and the result is, both visually and practically, gorgeous. Manuel cultivates groves of fruit trees, vegetable and flower gardens, and keeps bees. He makes his own fertilizer using his own compost which he augments with manure from a neighboring organic cattle farm. In 2015, he switched his coffee production to the honey process to mitigate his water usage with the added benefit of increasing cup quality.

His visit in 2019 feels like ages ago now and our visit to Marcala, another lifetime. Someday we’ll get to sit down with Manuel over a table full of Kuba Kuba or share a cup of his coffee in front of the wall in Broad Street that he helped us hang, but for now, we want you to know his name as well as his beautiful product.",,64e5b1ce2a0096c6f9935342,Blanchard's Coffee,https://blanchardscoffee.com/,https://blanchardscoffee.com/collections/shop-blends,,,,12 oz,,,,,,,,,,

In our cup, we catch a warm body of dark chocolate, hints of seared berry, and a candied walnut finish. But you may well find new shades, too; the spectrum has always room to grow. And for a coffee made with the help of so many, that’s a thing we believe worthy of cherishing.",,64e5b1902a0096c6f993533e,Wesley Andrews,https://wesleyandrews.cc/,https://wesleyandrews.cc/collections/shop-coffee,,,,250g,,,,,,,,,,

It holds up beautifully in milk drinks and as a compliment to flavors like vanilla and chocolate in lattes. Double Trouble isn’t just for espresso, though. It serves as a comforting filter coffee that’s equally pleasing served black or alongside milk and sugar. It also makes a flawless and chocolatey cold brew.

The current blend features coffees from two of our favorite origins, Brazil and Colombia. Currently, 50% of the blend is a natural processed coffee from Cerrado Mineiro, Brazil, that lends its big body and chocolate sweetness. The other 50% is from Huila, Colombia. This coffee lends a touch of vibrancy with notes of citrus, stone fruit and juicy acidity.

This blend is composed of microlots from four small producers from the micro-regions of San Agustín and Bruselas. The concept of a sub-regional blend comes from the desire to support smallholder farmers by combining very small lots to produce a larger coffee with better marketability. Truly, these lots together are greater than the sum of their parts. The four producers who have contributed lots to this coffee are:

Edilma Quinayas - San Agustín
Miller Quinayas - San Agustín
Luis Octavio Titimbo - Bruselas
Ana Nelly Luna - Bruselas

Decaf Amigos is decaffeinated using the Ethyl Acetate process. This process utilizes sugarcane, which is often grown at lower elevations than coffee and frequently planted at the bottom of the same mountains where coffee is grown. The Ethyl Acetate process gently extracts the caffeine from coffee beans as the solvent is washed over the beans repeatedly until more than 97% of the caffeine has been removed.",,64e5b1852a0096c6f993533d,Mammoth Coffee Company,https://mammothcoffee.co/,https://mammothcoffee.co/collections/coffee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

El Zacatin is a family-owned farm of 17 hectares situated in the highlands of Colombia’s southwest Antioquia department. The farm rests along the western slopes of the Cordillera mountains, overlooking the Cauca river valley.

Eduardo acquired Tabi seeds through an agronomist in Antioquia, and El Zacatin currently produces around 3 thousand kilos (6,600 lbs) of Tabi coffee. This particular lot of Natural process Tabi was selectively handpicked, sorted by hand to remove unripe cherries and then floated for additional quality sorting (in which “floaters,” the less desirable cherries, were removed). The coffee was then placed into a tank for 48 hours of aerobic fermentation, followed by sealing the tanks for 24 hours of anaerobic fermentation. The cherries are then spread out onto raised beds for 30 days to dry until the moisture content reaches 11%.
As a result of this intensive processing method, this single-variety Tabi has a refined sweetness and acidity, and an intense and exciting aromatic profile. Sweet cherry paste, reminiscent of fruit roll ups, is apparent upon first sip. As the coffee cools, it gives way to a pleasing lime acidity, with a depth and complexity similar to Ruby Port Wine.",,64e5b1852a0096c6f993533d,Mammoth Coffee Company,https://mammothcoffee.co/,https://mammothcoffee.co/collections/coffee,,,,250g,,,,,,,,,,

When grinders try to tackle both brewed coffee and espresso, they become a master of none. In stark contrast, Ode was designed to perfect your daily brewed coffee—pour-over, French press, cold brew, and more.

This Ode Grinder comes with pre-installed SSP MP Brew Burrs. This highly coveted burr set is coated in titanium aluminum carbon nitride coating (Red Speed), which makes them incredibly durable and increases the lifespan by up to 5x. For coffee nerds looking for extreme clarity and strong flavor separation, this burr choice is perfect for your home brew bar.

Note: This 120 V model can only be used in the US and Canada. Ode Brew Grinder is not an espresso grinder and it's not suitable for moka pots.

Stainless steel burrs, aluminum body, plastic load bin and base

Over the past few years, Juan Peña has become a prominent figure in the coffee industry. Season after season, he is up for awards as a notable coffee producer, and his coffee has been on the national and world stage in the hands of competitors. It would be easy to believe that Juan has been growing coffee for many decades, but Juan began growing coffee just eleven years ago. Juan’s farm, Hacienda a Papaya, chose to diversify their crop after a disastrous rose harvest, and choosing to experiment with coffee took them down the path to become a prominent producer of Ecuadorian coffee. His rise to prominence has been multifaceted, although it’s mostly due to his scientific approach to growing and processing his coffees. Each step of harvest is well documented and adjusted from season to season. This care is evident in the cup, this Anaerobic natural Typica exudes clear terroir of Ecuador coffee, as well as complex sweetness and floral notes from processing.

TechnoServe’s stated goal is to promote business solutions in the developing world by linking people to information, capital and markets. After spending 5 years educating the cooperative on farming and quality coffee production, TechnoServe funded the building of what are now some of the most respected washing stations in Ethiopia.

This coffee comes from the remote parts of the Sierra Mazateca mountains, where there are mostly closed indigenous communities. Most are not Spanish speakers, making this a very difficult region to work within. We are very excited to be working in this region because it is relatively unrepresented, and the micro climate seems ideal for producing complex cup profiles. We will continue learning more about this unique region as we explore these coffees in the years to come. Bourbon and Typica compose the most culturally and genetically important groups of coffees in the world. They are both low yielding, have very good cup quality potential, and are very susceptible to most diseases. Historical records indicate that seeds were taken to Yemen from the natural coffee forests of south west Ethiopia to be cultivated as a crop. Recent genetic tests have confirmed that Bourbon and Typica were the main seeds taken from Ethiopia to Yemen. From Yemen, descendants of Bourbon and Typica spread around the world, forming the basis of modern Arabica coffee cultivation.","July, 2020",64e5b1002a0096c6f9935338,Sey Coffee,https://www.seycoffee.com/,https://www.seycoffee.com/collections/coffee,USD,2023-10-17T17:34:09.810Z,,,,,,,,,,,,

When only a single seed is produced, it is referred to as a peaberry (“PB”). Normally these don't get separated out, however, in Kenya it is routine practice to separate out coffees based on size. Hence the AA, AB and PB labels on Kenyan coffees; AA are the largest seeds, AB are smaller seeds, and PB are the single or peaberry seeds. We normally go to Kenya to taste through all the cooperatives’ coffees each season, and make our selections based on the best coffees we can find. This year proved to be rather difficult because we were unable to travel. Still, thanks to the logistical proficiency of the exporters in Kenya, we were still able to sample some very very good offerings.

Kenya is a difficult place to work in not only because of its distance from New York, but also the complicated structure of the Kenyan coffee industry itself. The coffees available to purchase directly from single estates are generally lower quality than those we encounter from the larger cooperatives, but working with the co-ops creates its own issues of transparency, traceability, and the impossibility of making meaningful partnerships and investments towards better coffee, soil health, and farming practices. This particular co-op has 489 members, each of whom has an extremely small farm averaging about half a hectare (1.2 acres).

Fairly early in our partnership with the Divino Niño producer group, we were introduced to multiple members of the Cantillo family, all of whom produce excellent quality coffee.

During early conversations with producers at Divino Niño, we frequently heard of a coffee variety that is locally referred to as “variedad Cantillo”. While the trees of this variety are not particularly distinctive, the ripe cherries are rather unique in appearance, being bright yellowish orange in color with beautiful mottled “tiger-stripes”. While the precise genetic lineage of this mystery “Cantillo family” coffee variety is thus far unknown, our best guess is that it is a natural mutation of variedad Colombia, a very commonly cultivated Catimor hybrid with excellent disease resistance that is capable of producing excellent cup quality.

For this archival release, we're excited to share the last of this unique, if not mysterious, single variety, from a place and producing family we've grown quite fond of over the years.",2020,64e5b0e92a0096c6f9935336,Passenger Coffee,https://www.passengercoffee.com/,https://www.passengercoffee.com/collections/coffee,USD,2023-10-17T15:19:36.697Z,,200G,,,,,,,,,,

The Guduba wet mill is a washing station located near the village of Benti Nenka within the woreda (a “woreda” is a regional district) of Hambela Wamena, Guji. Over the 2019/2020 harvest, approximately 589 smallholder coffee farmers delivered their coffee cherry to the Guduba wet mill which is owned by Eyasu Worasa, a native of the region who brings over a decade of experience to his management of the washing station.
Thanks to well executed processing at high altitude, this selection offers an incredibly clean taste of the beautiful coffee varieties of the region: a mix of Ethiopian Landraces (a blend of indigenous Ethiopian coffee varieties) and selected varieties brought to the region from the Jimma Agricultural Research Center.
In 2020, we intentionally preserved a small amount of this green (raw) coffee in deep freeze storage so that we could present and celebrate it again today - around 3 years from its original harvest date. As with other stunning coffees from Guji that we've had the pleasure of tasting in the past, this offering from Beni Nenka is remarkably complex, offering a harmonious bouquet of floral and fruit-driven flavors. Intense aromatics of honeysuckle, rose, ripe nectarine, and browning sugars introduce a memorable cup with sumptuous flavors of bergamot, peach, and a candy-like watermelon note as the coffee cools.",2020,64e5b0e92a0096c6f9935336,Passenger Coffee,https://www.passengercoffee.com/,https://www.passengercoffee.com/collections/coffee,USD,2023-10-17T15:19:36.697Z,,200G,,,,,,,,,,

Why we love it
In this informative and beautifully illustrated book, Market Lane’s co-founder and co-director shares what years of research and experience in the specialty coffee industry have taught him so far.
Scheltus explains the history and science of the coffee bean, offering explanations and definitions for the words you see on coffee bags and hear coffee professionals discuss – terms like ‘pulped natural processing’ and ‘first crack’.
For home brewers, he shares tips for selecting good beans, and offers easy, tried-and-true recipes for each brew method. And for café goers, there are detailed descriptions of all the beverages on the menu, and a look at the different coffee-producing countries, and the flavour characteristics unique to each one.
Features gorgeous illustrations by Daniella Germaine (My Abuela’s Table).

Liquid Education: Coffee is a fantastic introduction to the world of coffee. Jason explores the history and science of the coffee bean, then explains some of the common terms you see on coffee bags and hear industry professionals use. He breaks down the different beverage items on the café menu, and offers tried-and-true recipes for several different brew methods to try at home.

Coffee: How to Buy It, How to Brew It offers a more in-depth guide to everyone’s favourite beverage. Jason provides instructions on how to select the best beans, and he looks at all the variables on the coffee farm that impact the taste in the cup. He also does a great job of accessibly explaining why coffee costs what it does, and why some bags of beans are priced dollars more than others.",,64e5b0a92a0096c6f9935334,Market Lane Coffee,https://marketlane.com.au/,https://marketlane.com.au/pages/coffee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tried many domestic grinders in our search for the best one, and the Baratza Encore came out as our favourite for filter coffee – we love its quality, consistency, precision and durability, and it's also great value for money.
The Encore is suitable for all filter coffee brewing methods – it grinds coarsely enough for a plunger brew and fine enough for pour over (as well as everything in between). The control mechanism is simple to use and it has 40 adjustment settings, allowing you to easily select the right grind size.
This grinder has high quality conical steel burrs that are easy to clean, and a powerful motor with burr speed control, which reduces heat, static and noise. The Baratza is built to last – the burrs will remain sharp for years and the glass-filled thermoplastic casing increases its longevity. The burrs are also replaceable and the machine is easily repairable if needed. It comes with a one-year warranty.
Please note: if you are looking for a good grinder that can also grind coffee for espresso, we would recommend considering this Breville grinder which is more user-friendly for espresso preparation.
If you’d like to chat to our staff about any of our grinders we are more than happy to help you via email, or you can pop into our Prahran shop for a demonstration.",,64e5b0a92a0096c6f9935334,Market Lane Coffee,https://marketlane.com.au/,https://marketlane.com.au/pages/coffee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hasami Porcelain is a line of modular and multi-functional ceramics established and designed by Takuhiro Shinomoto in 2012. It’s made in Hasami, a town in Japan’s Nagasaki prefecture well-known for its pottery manufacturing history, dating back more than 400 years. Hasami Porcelain successfully marries traditional Japanese aesthetics with functional modern design. Individual pieces are handmade and finished by a team of craftspeople in the Hasami village, each one contributing their speciality at each step of the process. This is how porcelain has been made here since the beginning of the Edo period! We’re big fans of Hasami Porcelain’s clever and beautiful design. Ceramics in the range safely nest into each other and stack up nicely, just like traditional Japanese lacquer tiered boxes – known as ‘jukabo’ – do. This mug is the smallest in the Hasami Porcelain line, and we love drinking coffee out of it.",,64e5b0a92a0096c6f9935334,Market Lane Coffee,https://marketlane.com.au/,https://marketlane.com.au/pages/coffee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The team at São Luiz Estate are blazing a trail in a young Brazilian coffee producing region, Cerrado Mineiro. Manoel Velloso dos Reis; a visionary, took over his father's land and imagined the potential for a new business: coffee in the 1960s. Later, his son Fausto do Espírito Santo Velloso, began investing in quality coffee.
Currently, Fausto's daughter, Ana Cecilia Velloso is managing the farm. In Ana’s words “Lucio and me are in charge of the management of the farm, with the responsibility of perpetuating this legacy through our young and innovative spirit, passion and enthusiasm. We produce high quality specialty coffees based on a model orientated to the valuation of people, in a true and transparent relationship with our customers and in constant search for new technologies and process efficiency”.

It is flying off the shelves at the cafe in Portland, really delivering full flavor in the cup.

Qonqona mill draws from the beautiful Qonqona river and is positioned 2km from the bustling town of Daye in the heart of Sidama, Ethiopia. The name of Qonqona's Manager is fitting: Eshettu, which means 'ripe fruit' or 'cherry'. The coffees here are as vivid and bright as the people who grow and process them, drawing from cherries between 1700 and 2100 masl in elevation. 
These two naturally occuring heirloom varietals known localled as Mikicho and Setami are vibrant and dynamic coffees! The Mikicho variety looks a lot like Geisha. These two varieties together offer a unique tea-like characteristics of heavy tropical fruits.

Bright red like a maple tree
in late autumn.

ーーーーー

The blotchy pale sunlight
in the afternoon.

It colours me like autumn leaves.

ーーーーー

Momiji blend has a smooth and bright flavour.

The soft body of the pomegranate jam and the honey that seeps out
 is a perfect balance of sour and sweet.

After the temperature drops, the sweetness changes to a rounded one.
The aftertaste is like a peach candy roll.

We deliver our monthly seasonal blend
with stories of the Japanese tradition of colours
for 2022.

①Pomegranate jam-like flavour and juicy acidity.
②The Melt-in-your-mouth sweetness of maple and honey.
③Slightly peachy, candy-like, with a colossal texture and lingering.

The butterfly(蝶), fluttering and dancing, epitomizes both transience and allure.

Filter Pour Over & Espresso Weighing all in one coffee scale
This sophisticated and minimalist smart scale brings new heights to connectivity - it's the world's first dual bluetooth scale! JIMMY has a detachable magnetic display bar that connects to the weigh scale via bluetooth and at the same time connects to the companion JIMMY App (available for iOS and Android). You can even control JIMMY with your Apple Watch!
Place the display bar anywhere you want thanks to the handy magnet on the back. Put it on the side of your espresso machine or anywhere else at eye level that a magnet will stick. By separating the display, Hiroia created a highly water-resistant, heat resistant scale that fits comfortably on a drip tray, all while making it easier to see the timer and weight measurement. On top of all that, the display is easy to use in any light condition - it's super bright and designed so you can read it from any angle.
JIMMY has customized modes for both pour-over and espresso, switchable with a gentle touch. And the JIMMY App has four different modes to bring out your inner coffee geek. Espresso Mode to record and save your brews or espresso extractions, Pour-over Mode where you can follow a recipe, Training Mode to practice your pouring speed, and JIMMY Mode for simply controlling JIMMY and displaying the real-time data.
The best part about JIMMY? It can easily be updated and upgraded through the JIMMY app. And there's enough memory in JIMMY for some serious upgrades.",,64e5b0642a0096c6f9935331,Moving Coffee,https://www.movingcoffee.com/,https://www.movingcoffee.com/collections/coffee,USD,2023-10-17T11:36:01.063Z,,,,,,,,,,,,

These products allow you to tailor the experience of the coffee’s aroma in a completely new way. Figgjo won the Red Dot Design Award in 2016 with this series designed by Kristin Hærnes Ihlen.

Tulip
“Tulipan” (Tulip) is designed for coffees with lower acidity like typical Bourbons from El Salvador, Brazil or Indian coffees. The cone shaped cup enhances more earthy aromas and gives you an impression that the coffee is very sweet as the liquid enters the mouth in a narrow stream and hits the middle of the tongue.

Split
“Splitt” (Split) is designed for coffees with intense fruity and floral aromas and bright acidity. Typically we use these cups for our Kenyan and Ethiopian coffees. The unique design enhances the aromatics when you smell the coffee in the cup and the wide shape makes the liquid enter your mouth with a wider spread so that you perceive acidity more clearly.

Open
“Åpen” (Open) is more of an all-round cup. The classic U-shape is a forgiving shape when it comes to taste balance yet it has the ability to intensify aromas when you smell the coffees. We typically use these cups for coffees that have fruity characters and medium intense acidity. The fun part is that you can play around with the different shapes with different coffees and change your guests perception of how the coffees taste like.",,64e5b0642a0096c6f9935331,Moving Coffee,https://www.movingcoffee.com/,https://www.movingcoffee.com/collections/coffee,USD,2023-10-17T11:36:01.063Z,,,,,,,,,,,,

The digital temperature control is outstanding, with features that help to reach a temperature, and hold that temperature, more easily and accurately, in a more intuitive manner than other kettles. The kettle holds 900ml, and this 220V/1200w version (with an EU plug), heats up very fast, and holds temperatures accurately. You can choose between Celsius or Fahrenheit for the display temperature, and toggle the HOLD function on or off. This is the same kettle that Matt Winton used to win the World Brewers Cup in 2021, and a strong recommendation for home brewers, as the flow control is excellent. The only downside to this kettle is that the flow rate is quite slow, so if you're looking to do big volume immersion brews, then there are better alternatives that suit.",,64e5aec22a0096c6f993532c,Rose Coffee Roasters,https://rose-coffee.com/,https://rose-coffee.com/collections/all,USD,2023-10-17T11:23:48.739Z,,,,,,,,,,,,

Still hand built in Scotland, the new Aergrind is now 100% plastic free and has been upgraded to be stronger, longer lasting, and more refined than its predecessor.

Following the success of his first grinder, the Feldgrind, Peter Kilpatrick designed the Aergrind: a compact version small enough to fit inside an Aeropress that still delivers professional performance.

Italmill burrs provide even grinding from espresso to filter
Improved top dial adjustment provides easy access
Stepless grind adjustment means unlimited settings
38mm burrs with improved titanium nitride coating
Magnetic, laser etched lid that snaps into place
New, larger bean chamber increases capacity
For the 2022 version of the Aergrind, key upgrades begin where it matters: the refreshed 38mm titanium nitrided conical burrs provide competition level grind consistency and a step up in class. Inside the grinder Knock has increased the axle bearing length by 100% to provide even greater stability and improved alignment. The refreshed profile of the crank arm is now 20% thicker providing greater stability when grinding.

Refinements continue with a thicker, more stable crank arm and a move from plastic to a large, walnut knob; a magnetic lid with laser etched dial that snaps into place; and a threaded lower tube with a profile that controls the precious coffee grounds inside.

""Made by Knock"" is a company based in Scotland. Peter Kilpatrick's mechanical designs are both popular and durable. We are one of the main distributors for the Aergrind and the Feldgrind in Germany.

The farm at Aquiares dates back to 1890, but it hasn’t been until the past few decades where Alfonso Robelo took control the farm, that a transformation towards a high-quality and environmentally sustainable model of production has taken place.

This is our first fresh harvest Costa Rican this year and this particular lot just advanced to second stage in national cup of excellence in Costa Rica. We will see the results in August. 

This coffee is very much round and sweet but with an elegant acidity. A well structured and smooth cup with notes of hazelnut, toffee and apricot which bring a delightful sweetness. 

Aquiares focuses on carbon neutrality and measures its greenhouse gas emissions to calculate its carbon emissions against its offsets. An agent verified under the International Panel on Climate Change norms verifies these calculations and Aquiares’ carbon measurement and emissions reduction are part of Costa Rica’s Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action.

In addition to capturing carbon, the farm’s protected biological corridors have long ensured the wellbeing of local animals and plants. Aquiares also welcomes researchers from around the world to conduct agricultural and environmental studies on their land. Projects have included investigating the benefits of agroforestry on soil health and observing the diverse bird and wildlife species that thrive in an agroecological environment.

Aquiares is an example of innovation and perseverance whose benefits extend beyond the farm and workers and serve as a model for sustainable, equitable production for the broader coffee industry. The lots selected by Ally Coffee from Aquiares represent our shared commitment to sustainability, equity, and innovation.",,64e5ad552a0096c6f993531f,Prolog Coffee,https://www.prologcoffee.com/,https://www.prologcoffee.com/collections/buy-our-coffee,USD,2023-10-17T13:01:20.484Z,,250g,,,,,,,,,,

Pascoal,,"Our subscription journey continues, and this time we are taken to the savannah in Cerrado. The hilly landscape is vast and plain leaving us with a crystal-clear horizon as far as the eye can see.

The coffee farm, Daterra is in the Brazilian part of Cerrado and is founded by Luis N. Pascoal.

In your envelope, you will find two coffees from this spectacular producer sourced exclusively for you, our subscribers!

The Sweet Yellow is one of the best coffees grown at Daterra. It has an incredibly rich mouthfeel and a syrupy sweetness. The clean and balanced coffee has the aromas of pecan nuts and chocolate.

The other coffee from Daterra is named Blossom. Blossom is from the variety Aramosa and Guarani and was named by the cuppers at Daterra because of the heavy floral notes they found.

This is a clean and soothing coffee. The intense sweetness is backed up by light notes of milk chocolate.",,64e5aa892a0096c6f993531b,Coffee Collective,https://coffeecollective.dk/,https://coffeecollective.dk/shop/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As typical in Kenya, Githembe works with a cooperative model. This means there is a group of self-employed farmers who each grow their own coffee. After picking the ripest and highest quality coffee cherries, the farmers then sell directly to the wet mill for processing into the green coffee that Prolog receives. The smallholder farmers delivering cherries to the Kaiguri mill have an average of 250 coffee trees each. Other crops grown are maize, bananas and beans, in order to diversify the growing environment and provide supplementary income for the farmers.

The farm at Aquiares dates back to 1890, but it hasn’t been until the past few decades where Alfonso Robelo took control the farm, that a transformation towards a high-quality and environmentally sustainable model of production has taken place.

These days, Alfonso’s son Diego manages the day-to-day operations at the farm. Diego has continued his father’s lead and has innovated significantly, in order to reach greater heights of quality and sustainability.

Large spaces on the farm are designated as protected biological corridors in order to ensure the continuing flourishing health of the of the plants and animals in the area. Projects that the farm has conducted have shown a positive effect from this agroforestry on the health of their soils.

In terms of long term environmental sustainability, a high natural level of soil health is extremely important in ensuring that plants can receive the levels of nutrition required to flourish in their environment and produce abundant, sweet fruits. All this, without the need for outside inputs that can be damaging to the surrounding habitat.

New research and experimentation have also been conducted with the type of coffee varieties that Aquiares are planting and also the post-harvest processing of the coffees.
